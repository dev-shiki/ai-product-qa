Port selection matters, so multiple USB-C (Thunderbolt if possible), USB-A, HDMI, and an SD card reader would be great. How do models like Dell XPS, MacBook Pro (if compatible with my software), HP ZBook, or Razer Blade compare for my needs? Are there any other professional workstations you would recommend?
