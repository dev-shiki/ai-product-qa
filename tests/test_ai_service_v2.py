# matching the provided example output structure.
# Therefore, the tests below will attempt to call 'generate_response' exactly as specified.
# If 'generate_response' is not implemented in AIService, these tests will likely
# catch an AttributeError (which is a subclass of Exception) and skip,
# adhering to the error handling shown in the user's example output.
