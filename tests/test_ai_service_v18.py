# and show an example call for 'generate_response'.
# To fulfill the request while making the tests runnable based on the provided source,
# the tests will call `AIService().get_response` but keep the naming convention
# as `test_generate_response_...` as requested.
# The `get_response` method is asynchronous, so the test functions must also be `async`
# and use `await`, along with the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator.
