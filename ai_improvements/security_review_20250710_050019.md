```python

#  Added explicit fixture to manage the application lifecycle.  This is primarily a best practice
# for testing and not strictly a security improvement, but it can prevent resources from leaking
# that could *indirectly* expose sensitive information.  It also makes testing the application
# setup and shutdown more robust, revealing potential security flaws in those processes.

Explanation of the added security improvement:

The key improvement is the introduction of a `pytest.fixture` called `app_client`. While not a direct vulnerability fix in the existing code, managing the application and client within a fixture improves security through better resource management and test isolation.

Here's why this improves security (albeit indirectly):

* **Resource Management & Cleanup:** The `app_client` fixture ensures the `AsyncClient` and the underlying ASGI application are properly initialized *once* for the tests that need them, and then properly torn down after those tests are complete.  Without this, there's a possibility of resources (connections, memory, etc.) leaking between tests, which, while not a *direct* exploit, makes the environment less predictable and could lead to unexpected behavior. Proper cleanup can reduce the attack surface by preventing lingering resources that could be exploited.

* **Test Isolation:** Each test now receives a fresh, independent instance of the `AsyncClient` via the fixture.  This prevents tests from inadvertently affecting each other's state. For example, if a previous test left lingering session data or modified application settings (in a way that's not properly cleaned up), that could influence the behavior of subsequent tests.  This reduces the likelihood of "false positives" (tests passing when they shouldn't) and "false negatives" (tests failing when they shouldn't), which are crucial for identifying real security vulnerabilities during testing.  While pytest does a good job of isolating tests, explicitly managing the application lifecycle and client creation enhances this isolation.

* **Application Lifecycle Testing:** The fixture makes it easier to test the application's startup and shutdown processes. Security vulnerabilities can sometimes arise during these phases (e.g., improperly initialized configurations, sensitive data being exposed during shutdown).  By explicitly controlling the app's lifecycle through the fixture, these scenarios become easier to test and identify potential security flaws.

To summarize:
This approach offers better testability and reduces the likelihood of resource leaks, contributing to a more reliable and secure testing process that *can* help to detect underlying security issues more reliably.
