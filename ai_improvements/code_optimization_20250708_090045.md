# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Use `json.loads` instead of `json.load` if your test already has the JSON data in a string.

**Explanation:**  The code snippet provided uses `json.load` which is designed to load JSON data directly from a file-like object (e.g., a file opened with `open()`).  If the test fixture is already creating the JSON data as a Python dictionary (which is implied by the return type), then you can avoid a redundant write/read to a file (if that's happening in the unshown code). Instead, directly use the dictionary as needed for the tests. This is more efficient if you already have the data in memory. If the intent is to mock reading from a JSON file, then the data should be converted to a string using `json.dumps` and then passed to the mock.
