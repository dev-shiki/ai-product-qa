## Quick Insights

1. **Structure & Modularity:**  Consider restructuring `app` into more focused sub-packages. Instead of just `app/api/`, explore `app/api/products/`, `app/api/queries/` to better encapsulate related logic and improve maintainability as the project grows. This enhances discoverability and reduces potential naming conflicts.

2. **Testing Strategy:**  Analyze test coverage.  Are tests primarily unit tests or are integration tests also present? Ensure a balanced approach. Aim for tests that cover critical business logic within `main.py`, `queries.py`, and `products.py` to catch integration errors and ensure core functionality remains robust.
