## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Move configuration values (database connection strings, API keys, etc.) out of the code and into a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `.env` or `config.py`).  Use a library like `python-dotenv` or `Dynaconf` for easy management and environment-specific settings. This promotes cleaner code and easier deployment.

2.  **Standardized Logging:** Implement a structured logging system using the `logging` module, with consistent formatting and severity levels across all files. This will significantly improve debugging and monitoring capabilities, especially as the project grows.
