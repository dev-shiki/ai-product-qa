## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Type Hinting & Linting:** Enforce type hinting throughout the codebase (using `mypy`, for example) to catch errors early and improve code readability. Pair this with a linter like `flake8` (or `pylint`) to ensure consistent code style across all 21 files. This will improve code maintainability.

2.  **Test Coverage:** With 8 test files covering 21 source files, assess your test coverage.  Aim for high coverage (e.g., >80%) to ensure critical functionality is well-tested. Consider using a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to identify areas needing more tests.
