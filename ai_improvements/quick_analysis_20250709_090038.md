# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 09:00:38  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvements for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a consistent code style**: Use a linter (like Flake8 with plugins) and a formatter (like Black) to enforce PEP 8 standards and consistent formatting across all files. This will improve readability and maintainability.

2.  **Introduce a proper testing framework:** While 8 test files exist, ensure you're using a robust framework like `pytest` or `unittest`. Integrate test discovery, proper assertions, and consider using test-driven development (TDD) for new features. This improves code reliability.
