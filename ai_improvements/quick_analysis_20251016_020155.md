**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all 21 files. This will improve readability and maintainability, reducing future debugging efforts.

2.  **Increase test coverage:** Having 8 test files is good, but aim for higher code coverage. Focus on testing critical logic in files like `queries.py` and `products.py` to ensure robustness. Consider using a coverage tool to identify areas needing more tests.
