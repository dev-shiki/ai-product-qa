```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
import asyncio  # Import asyncio at the top

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword[:50]}") # Limit logging of keyword
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method

            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword[:50]}") # Limit logging of keyword
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error searching products: {str(e)}")
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
            else:
                return self.get_all_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:

        """Get available categories"""
        try:
            return self.local_service.get_categories()

            return []

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security concern addressed is **information disclosure** through excessive logging. Specifically, the original code logged the entire `keyword` used for searching products.  If this keyword contained sensitive information (e.g., a user's full name, partial credit card number, or other Personally Identifiable Information (PII)), it would be exposed in the logs.

The modified code limits the length of the `keyword` logged to the first 50 characters using `keyword[:50]`.  This mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive information while still providing useful context for debugging.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Compliance:**  Regulations like GDPR and CCPA have strict rules around handling PII. Logging sensitive data can lead to compliance violations and hefty fines.
*   **Security:**  Exposed sensitive data in logs can be exploited by attackers who gain access to the log files. They could use this information for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious activities.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Even if keyword filtering or sanitization is performed elsewhere in the application, limiting logging provides an additional layer of security in case those other measures fail or are bypassed.

**Other Considerations:**

*   **Context:** Evaluate what kind of data `keyword` is expected to contain.  If it's *always* expected to be highly sensitive, consider hashing or completely omitting it from logs instead of truncating.
*   **Log Retention:**  Implement a log retention policy to automatically delete logs after a certain period.  This limits the window of vulnerability.
*   **Access Control:**  Restrict access to log files to authorized personnel only.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Use a centralized logging system that provides secure storage and access controls for logs.

This single change significantly improves the security posture of the code by reducing the risk of sensitive information being inadvertently exposed in logs.  It is a simple, effective measure that should be a standard practice in all applications that handle user input.
