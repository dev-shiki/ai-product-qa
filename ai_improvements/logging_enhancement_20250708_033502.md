## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (optional, but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    logger.info(f"get_products: Received request with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        logger.info(f"get_products: Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("get_products: An exception occurred while retrieving products.")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  This line is crucial. It imports the Python `logging` module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`:**  This sets up basic logging.  `level=logging.INFO` means that log messages with a level of `INFO` or higher (e.g., `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) will be displayed.  You can change the level to `logging.DEBUG` for more detailed output during development.  This is *optional* but strongly recommended for any real-world application. Without this, you might not see any log messages.  If you're using a more complex logging setup (e.g., logging to a file or using a different format), you would configure that here instead.
* **`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`:** Creates a logger instance.  `__name__` is the name of the current module, which helps identify where the log messages are coming from.
* **`logger.info(...)`:** Logs informational messages.  These are used to track the normal flow of the function. I've added log statements at the beginning to record the input parameters and after a successful retrieval to indicate how many products were found.
* **`logger.exception(...)`:**  This is *critically* important.  It logs the exception *and* a stack trace. This makes debugging much easier because you get the full context of the error.  Use this inside the `except` block.  It's generally better than `logger.error(str(e))` because it provides the stack trace.
* **Clearer Log Messages:** The log messages now include the function name (`get_products`) to make them easier to identify in the logs.
* **Handles the Exception Properly:**  The `except` block now logs the exception *before* raising the `HTTPException`.  This ensures that the error is recorded even if the API call fails.

This revised solution provides robust logging that will be extremely helpful for debugging and monitoring your application. Remember to configure the logging level appropriately for your environment (e.g., `DEBUG` in development, `INFO` or `WARNING` in production).
