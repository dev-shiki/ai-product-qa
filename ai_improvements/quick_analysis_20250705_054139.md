# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 05:41:39  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure (21 Python files, 8 test files, and an `app` directory with `api` subdirectories), here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Enhance API Module Organization:**  Standardize API module structure.  Consider breaking down `products.py` and other API files into smaller, more manageable files based on resource or functionality.  Document the API endpoints clearly (using docstrings or a dedicated documentation file) for better maintainability.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage Reporting:** Implement a test coverage reporting tool (e.g., `coverage.py`).  This identifies untested code and helps prioritize writing new tests.  Aim for a reasonable coverage target (e.g., 80%) to ensure the core functionality is well-tested.
