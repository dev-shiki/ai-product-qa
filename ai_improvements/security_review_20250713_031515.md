**Improvement:**

*   **Explicit Exception Handling and Logging in `test_get_product_by_id_error`:**  The original `test_search_products_error` method handles the exception from the mocked service by returning an empty list.  However, `test_get_product_by_id_error` silently fails.  This is changed to explicitly check that the `get_product_by_id` method raises an exception when the mocked `local_service` raises an exception.  This is done using `pytest.raises`.  It is important to check that the right exception is being raised and not a generic exception.  In addition, the logging is added so that unexpected exceptions can be monitored.

**Explanation of the Improvement:**

The original `test_get_product_by_id_error` test was insufficient. It mocked an exception but didn't properly assert that the code under test (i.e., the `get_product_by_id` method of `ProductDataService`) actually *handled* that exception in a predictable way.  The added pytest assertion `with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Product retrieval error"):` verifies that when `mock_local_service.get_product_by_id` raises an `Exception`, the `product_service.get_product_by_id` method also raises an Exception that matches the defined exception message.

This is crucial for a robust test suite because it ensures:

1.  **Exception Propagation:** The code isn't accidentally swallowing or ignoring errors that occur in its dependencies (like the `local_service`).
2.  **Correct Error Handling:** The code handles the exception appropriately.   Ideally, it should either re-raise the exception, log the error and then proceed appropriately (e.g. log to the console and re-raise the exception for calling code to deal with).  If it's intended to catch and handle the exception, the test needs to assert the *result* of that handling. (e.g. does it return `None`, log an error, etc.)

By explicitly asserting that an exception is raised, you confirm that your code's error handling is working as intended.  The test is designed to catch and verify the error handling behaviour, rather than merely mocking a service to throw an error. It validates how your component reacts to those failures. The inclusion of logging means that exceptions are monitored (assuming there is adequate monitoring).

This change enhances the reliability and maintainability of the test suite and improves the overall quality of the application by ensuring that exception handling is tested.
