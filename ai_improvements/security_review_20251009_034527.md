**Improvement:**

Add logging for error conditions to improve observability and aid in debugging during failures.

**Explanation:**

The original code lacked proper error handling and observability.  While the `test_search_products_error` test case confirms that the code gracefully handles exceptions during the product search, it doesn't actually *log* the error.  In a production environment, this is problematic because you'd have no record of why a search failed, making debugging difficult.  Adding logging provides a way to track these errors.

The `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` line sets up basic logging to the console. In a real application, you'd likely configure logging to write to a file or use a more sophisticated logging setup.  Then, inside the `ProductDataService` (which is not included in the provided code snippet, but where the `search_products` method is actually implemented), you should add a `try...except` block and log the exception:

```python
# Example of how you'd implement the logging in ProductDataService.py
import logging

class ProductDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()

    async def search_products(self, search_term: str, limit: int) -> list:
        """Search products based on a search term."""
        try:
            return await self.local_service.search_products(search_term, limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.exception(f"Error during product search: {e}") # Log the full exception traceback
            return []
```

By logging the exception *including the traceback*, you get valuable information about the exact line of code where the error occurred, the chain of function calls leading to the error, and any relevant local variables. This makes debugging significantly easier.  If logging is implemented at the function and service levels, the test file will benefit from its use.
