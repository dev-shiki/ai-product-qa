**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Enforce Consistent Style:** With 21 Python files, using a linter and formatter like Flake8 and Black (integrated with pre-commit hooks) is crucial. This automates style checks, reducing code review burden and promoting readability across the entire codebase.

2. **Improve Test Coverage:** 8 test files might not be enough. Track test coverage using `coverage.py` to identify gaps and ensure critical functionalities, especially in `app/utils/config.py` (likely central to the application), are thoroughly tested. Aim for a higher coverage percentage.
