## Quick Insights

1. **Implement a consistent code style and linting:** Use a tool like Black and Flake8 (or Ruff for both) to automatically format and check your code. This improves readability, reduces errors, and facilitates collaboration. Consistent style also helps in identifying potential bugs easier.

2. **Consider a more comprehensive testing strategy:** While 8 test files are a good start, ensure good test coverage, especially for critical logic in `product.py` and your main application entrypoint.  Implement unit tests, integration tests, and potentially end-to-end tests depending on complexity.
