```

**Refactoring Improvement:**

The code that extracts the category and price from the user's question has been moved into a separate function called `extract_category_and_price`.  This improves code modularity, readability, and testability.  The original code was embedded within the `ask_question` function, making it long and harder to understand. By extracting it, we've created a more focused and reusable component.

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Function Extraction:** The category and price extraction logic is now encapsulated within the `extract_category_and_price` function.  It takes the user's question as input and returns the extracted category and maximum price (or `None` if they can't be found).
2.  **Type Hints:** Type hints have been added to the `extract_category_and_price` function for better code clarity and maintainability (e.g., `-> tuple[Optional[str], Optional[float]]`).  This specifies the expected input and output types.
3.  **Improved Price Extraction:**  The original code may have been too simple to reliably extract prices. The improved regex `r"(maksimal|kurang dari|di bawah) (Rp\s?)?([\d.,]+)"` now handles variations in how prices are expressed (e.g., "maksimal Rp 1.000.000", "kurang dari 1,000,000", "di bawah Rp1000000"). It also handles possible decimal separators ("," or "."). A `try-except` block is added to handle cases where the extracted price string cannot be converted to a float, logging a warning in such scenarios.
4.  **Category Detection Improvement**  The dictionary `category_mapping` is used to more completely try to figure out what category the question is in.
5.  **Clarity and Readability:** The extracted function improves the overall readability of the `ask_question` function, as it focuses on its primary responsibility of handling the API request.
6.  **Reusability:** The `extract_category_and_price` function can now be reused in other parts of the application if needed.
7.  **Testability:** It is now much easier to unit test the category and price extraction logic in isolation, without having to go through the entire API endpoint.  This ensures that the extraction logic works correctly and consistently.

This refactoring makes the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to test.
