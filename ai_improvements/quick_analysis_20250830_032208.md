## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions:

1.  **Add Docstrings:** Ensure all functions, classes, and modules have clear docstrings. This improves readability and helps others (and your future self) understand the code's purpose and usage. Tools like Sphinx can then generate documentation from these.

2.  **Introduce Linting:** Implement a linter like Flake8 or Pylint to automatically check for code style issues and potential errors. This enforces a consistent style across the project, reducing bugs and making the code easier to maintain.  Integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline.
