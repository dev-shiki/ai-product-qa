```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The provided code adds a validator to the `Product` model for the `images` field.  This validator, `validate_images`, checks if the image URLs provided are relative paths (starting with `./` or `../`).  If a relative path is detected, a `ValueError` is raised, preventing the potentially unsafe URL from being accepted.

**Why is this a security improvement?**

*   **Preventing Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  If the `images` field accepts relative paths, a malicious user could potentially construct a path that leads to files outside of the intended image directory on the server. This could allow an attacker to access sensitive files, configuration files, or even execute arbitrary code, depending on how the image URLs are used.

**Further improvements can be made:**

*   **Robust URL Validation:**  The current validation only checks for relative paths. A more comprehensive solution would involve parsing the URLs to ensure they are valid URLs, using a URL parsing library. Specifically, verify:
    *   The URL scheme is either `http` or `https`.
    *   The hostname is a valid hostname and potentially allow-listed (if you only expect images from certain domains).
    *   The URL is properly encoded.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers on your web server to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded, further mitigating the risk of malicious images.
*   **Image Scanning:** Scan uploaded images for malware before storing and serving them.
*   **Consider using UUIDs for file names** Using a UUID would remove the ability for an attacker to guess file names and attempt to download them.
