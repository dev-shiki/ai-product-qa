**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider a proper package structure.** While you have an `app` directory, ensure its treated as a proper Python package with an `__init__.py` file. If `app/api` grows, break it down further into sub-packages (e.g., `app/api/products/`, `app/api/queries/`) to improve organization and maintainability.

2.  **Evaluate test coverage.** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, ensure your tests adequately cover the main functionality, especially in `main.py`, `queries.py`, and `products.py`. Use a coverage tool (like `pytest-cov`) to identify untested code paths and improve confidence in your codebase.
