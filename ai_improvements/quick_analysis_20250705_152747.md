## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Move configuration variables (API keys, database URLs, etc.) out of the code and into a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `config.py`, `.env` using `python-dotenv`). This enhances security, maintainability, and deployment flexibility by separating code from environment-specific settings.

2.  **Explicit API Blueprint Registration:** In `./app/api/__init__.py`, explicitly register API blueprints (e.g., products, users). This clarifies the structure of your API, improves modularity, and makes it easier to manage different API endpoints as the project grows.
