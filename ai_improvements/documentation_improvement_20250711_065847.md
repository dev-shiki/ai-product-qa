async def ask_question(request: QueryRequest):
    """
    Asks a question about products and retrieves relevant information and product recommendations.

    This endpoint takes a user's question as input, leverages an AI service to generate an answer,
    and then retrieves relevant product information based on the question.  It attempts to extract
    category and price information from the question to refine the product search.

    Args:
        request (QueryRequest): A Pydantic model containing the user's question.

    Returns:
        QueryResponse: A Pydantic model containing the AI-generated answer, a list of relevant products,
                       the original question, and a fallback note if no products are found.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: If there is an error communicating with the AI service or the product data service.

        category_mapping = {
            'laptop': ['laptop', 'notebook', 'komputer'],
            'smartphone': ['smartphone', 'hp', 'handphone', 'phone', 'telepon', 'ponsel'],
            'tablet': ['tablet', 'ipad'],

            'drone': ['drone', 'quadcopter'],
            'jam': ['jam', 'watch', 'smartwatch']
        }
        
... (truncated for analysis)
```

Key improvements in the docstring:

* **Clear and Concise Summary:** The first line provides a brief, clear explanation of the function's purpose.
* **Detailed Description:**  Expands on the summary, explaining the process of answering the question, including AI interaction, product retrieval, and category extraction.
* **Args Section:**  Clearly documents the input parameter `request`, specifying its type and describing its contents (the user's question).
* **Returns Section:**  Describes the `QueryResponse` model, outlining the different fields it contains (answer, products, question, note). This helps users understand the structure of the output.
* **Raises Section:**  Specifies potential exceptions that might be raised (in this case, `HTTPException`) and the conditions under which they occur (errors communicating with external services).
* **Improved Readability:**  Uses consistent formatting and clear language for better understanding.
* **Completeness:**  The docstring now provides a comprehensive overview of the function's behavior, inputs, and outputs. This is crucial for code maintainability and usability.
