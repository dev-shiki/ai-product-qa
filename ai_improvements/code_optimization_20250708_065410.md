# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Cache the API Base URL

**Improvement:**  Define `API_BASE_URL` as a constant outside the `main` function, or even better, use `st.cache_data`.

**Explanation:**

While the code snippet is truncated, the `API_BASE_URL` is likely used multiple times throughout the application. Defining it as a constant at the module level (outside the function) avoids re-reading it every time `main` (or any function that uses it) is called. A more robust approach is to use `st.cache_data` to cache the result of a function that generates this URL if it's dynamically generated at runtime.
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import time

# Configuration
API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # Define as a constant

@st.cache_data
def get_api_base_url():
    return "http://localhost:8000" #Or read it from a config file

def main():
    #use API_BASE_URL or get_api_base_url() throughout your code

```
By caching `get_api_base_url()` Streamlit stores the URL in a local cache and avoids recomputing/re-reading it. The `st.cache_data` decorator ensures that this value is only computed once (or when the function's inputs change if any are defined).  This is especially useful if the API URL is based on environment variables or other configurations that don't change frequently, preventing unnecessary recalculations and improving performance. This will also prevent repeated reading of a config file.
