# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:23:02  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Consider a linter and formatter:** Implement a linter (like Flake8) and formatter (like Black) to enforce consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability and reduces potential errors, especially beneficial with multiple files. Integrate it into your workflow with pre-commit hooks.

2.  **Assess test coverage:** With 8 test files and 21 source files, evaluate your test coverage using a tool like `pytest-cov`. Identify areas with low coverage and prioritize writing tests for critical functions and modules. Aim for a coverage percentage appropriate for your project's risk tolerance.
