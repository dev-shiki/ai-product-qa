# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Move the `mock_json_data` fixture content (the large JSON data) into a separate JSON file and load it.

**Explanation:**

Instead of hardcoding the `mock_json_data` within the Python file, move the large JSON string to a dedicated `.json` file (e.g., `mock_products.json`).  This offers several benefits:

1.  **Readability:** Makes the Python code much cleaner and easier to read. The test setup is less cluttered.

2.  **Maintainability:**  JSON data is often edited and updated separately. Keeping it in a dedicated file separates data changes from code changes.

3.  **Potential Reuse:** If you have other tests that need similar data, you can reuse the same JSON file.

**Example Implementation (assuming a new file called `mock_products.json` containing the JSON data):**

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
import pytest
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_json_data():
    """Load JSON data from file for testing"""
    file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "mock_products.json"  # Adjust path as needed
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

Key improvements of this approach:

*   **Cleaner code:** The test file is now more concise and readable.
*   **Easier to modify test data:** Changes to the test data only require editing the `mock_products.json` file.
*   **Improved organization:**  Separates code from data.
