**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The most critical security improvement is **input validation** on the `test_ask_question` endpoint.  Specifically, I've added checks to ensure that the `question` parameter received from the client is:

1.  **A string:**  This prevents unexpected data types from being processed, potentially causing errors or exploits.
2.  **Within a reasonable length:** This prevents excessively long questions from being submitted, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or buffer overflows (if the backend doesn't handle large inputs properly).  The length limit of 1-200 characters is an example and should be adjusted based on the expected use case and the backend's capacity.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Injection Attacks:** Without input validation, an attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) into the `question` parameter. This code could then be executed on the backend, potentially compromising the database or the server. The AI service could also be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks if not properly sandboxed.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Large input strings could exhaust server resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:**  Sending non-string data might cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
*   **Prompt Injection:** The question might be crafted to manipulate the AI's behavior in unintended and potentially harmful ways.

**How to implement the improvement in the real application:**

1.  **Apply validation on the *server-side* (not just in the tests).** The tests are simulating the client-side. The critical validation must occur in the actual API endpoint code in `app.main.py` or wherever the `/api/queries/ask` route is handled.
2.  **Use a robust validation library:** For a production application, consider using a dedicated validation library like Pydantic or Marshmallow. These libraries provide powerful and declarative ways to define data schemas and validate input.  They handle a wide range of data types and validation rules.
3.  **Sanitize the Input:** In addition to validating the *format* and *length* of the input, consider sanitizing the input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  Libraries like `bleach` (for HTML sanitization) or regular expressions can be used for this purpose.  However, sanitization should be done carefully, as it can sometimes interfere with legitimate use cases.
4.  **Error Handling:**  If the input validation fails, return a clear and informative error message to the client (e.g., a 400 Bad Request status code with a message explaining the validation error).
5.  **Logging:** Log any failed validation attempts for security auditing and analysis.

This single improvement of adding basic input validation is a crucial first step towards hardening the application against common web vulnerabilities.
