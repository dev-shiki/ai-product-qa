## Quick Insights

1.  **Introduce a linter and formatter (e.g., Flake8, Black):**  Consistent code style improves readability and maintainability across 21 files. A linter also catches potential errors early, reducing debugging time.

2.  **Implement logging:**  Given the complexity suggested by 21 files, proper logging (especially in `main.py` and `utils/config.py`) is crucial for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior. This will allow you to better understand what your application is doing and if there are any errors.
