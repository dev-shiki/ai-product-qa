**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The primary security improvement implemented here is using `os.path.join` instead of directly concatenating file paths with `/`.

*   **Path Injection Prevention:**  Directly concatenating strings to create file paths can lead to path injection vulnerabilities.  If any part of the `current_dir`, `"data"`, or `"products.json"` are influenced by user input (which, though not immediately apparent in this specific snippet, is a common scenario in larger applications), an attacker could manipulate the path to access files outside the intended directory.  For instance, they could use ".." to navigate up the directory tree and potentially access sensitive files.

*   **`os.path.join` for Safe Path Construction:** The `os.path.join` function intelligently and safely combines path components. It handles the correct path separator for the operating system (e.g., `/` on Linux/macOS and `\` on Windows) and, more importantly, it sanitizes the path to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. It does this by normalizing the path, resolving relative components like ".." and ensuring the resulting path is within the expected boundaries. While not a silver bullet, it significantly reduces the risk of path injection.

*   **`os.path.exists` instead of `Path.exists`**: To consistently use the `os` module, I replaced `json_file_path.exists()` with `os.path.exists(json_file_path)`.

By using `os.path.join`, the code becomes more robust against path manipulation attacks, improving the overall security of the application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **User Input Validation:** While `os.path.join` is a good practice, it's crucial to also validate any user input that contributes to the file path.  This defense-in-depth approach provides additional protection.  If user input is used in path construction, you MUST validate and sanitize the input!  Consider whitelisting allowed characters or patterns.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access the required files. This limits the impact of a successful attack.

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

This response addresses the most immediate security concern within the given code snippet while highlighting the importance of secure coding practices related to file path handling.  Remember that security is an ongoing process and requires a layered approach.
