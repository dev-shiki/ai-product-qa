## Quick Insights

1. **Enhance Code Organization:** Given multiple Python files, especially within the `app/api` directory, consider using a more structured approach for API endpoints.  Explore using a framework like Flask or FastAPI for clear routing, request handling, and middleware implementation. This improves maintainability and scalability.

2. **Improve Test Coverage & Quality:** With a ratio of ~2.6 Python files per test file, review test coverage.  Focus on testing edge cases and critical functionalities in modules like `queries.py` and `products.py`.  Consider using a coverage tool to identify gaps. Well-written tests prevent regressions and make refactoring safer.
