## Improvement

Okay, I need to know which specific part of the data models you'd like me to focus on.  Since I don't have any existing code, I'll create a simple example data model and demonstrate how to add error handling to one specific part of it.

Let's assume we have a data model for a `Product` and we want to focus on error handling when setting the `price` attribute.

```python
"""
Data models for the application.
"""

class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price  # Delegate to the setter method

    @property
    def price(self):
        return self._price

    @price.setter
    def price(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("Price must be a number (int or float)")
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
        self._price = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Product(name='{self.name}', price={self.price})"

# Example Usage (with error handling)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        product1 = Product("Laptop", 1200.00)
        print(product1)

        product2 = Product("Book", -15)  # Will raise a ValueError
        print(product2)

    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error creating product: {e}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error creating product: {e}")

    try:
        product3 = Product("T-shirt", "expensive")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error creating product: {e}")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error creating product: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Explicit Type Checking:**  The `price.setter` now explicitly checks if the `value` is an instance of `int` or `float`.  This prevents unexpected behavior if a string or other data type is passed.  `isinstance()` is the preferred way to check for types.

2. **Value Range Validation:** The setter also validates that the `price` is not negative. This is a common business rule that should be enforced at the data model level.

3. **Descriptive Exceptions:**  Instead of just failing silently or raising a generic exception, `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions are raised with clear, informative messages.  This makes debugging much easier.

4. **Error Handling in Usage:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to use the `Product` class and, crucially, how to wrap the creation of `Product` instances in `try...except` blocks.  This allows you to catch the `ValueError` or `TypeError` exceptions that might be raised and handle them gracefully (e.g., log the error, display a user-friendly message, or retry with different data).  It's *essential* to handle the exceptions at the point where you're using the data model.

5. **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The error handling logic is focused on the `price` setter.  This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.  If you need to add more validation rules for the price later, you can do so within the setter without affecting other parts of the class.

How to Adapt for Other Scenarios:

*   **Identify the Critical Attributes:** Determine which attributes of your data model are most likely to cause errors if they have invalid values (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, dates, IDs).

*   **Add Validation to Setters:**  For each critical attribute, create a setter method (using the `@property` and `@<attribute>.setter` decorators).  Inside the setter, add validation logic to check for invalid values.  Raise appropriate exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `AssertionError`, or custom exceptions) with descriptive messages.

*   **Handle Exceptions at the Call Site:**  Wherever you create or modify instances of your data model, wrap the code in `try...except` blocks to catch the exceptions that might be raised by the setters.  Handle the exceptions gracefully based on the needs of your application.

This improved version is much more robust and reliable than a version without proper error handling.  Let me know if you have a specific data model you'd like me to help you improve, and I can provide more tailored guidance.
