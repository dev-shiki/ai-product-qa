**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Increase Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, aim for higher test coverage. Use a coverage tool to identify untested code paths and prioritize writing unit tests for critical areas like `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`.

2.  **Introduce Linting & Formatting:** Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early. Integrate a linter (like flake8 or pylint) and a formatter (like black) into your development workflow and CI/CD pipeline. This promotes code readability and reduces bugs.
