## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:**  Move hardcoded values (database URLs, API keys) into a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or using environment variables). This enhances maintainability and security by separating code from configuration, making deployments easier.

2. **Consistent Logging:** Implement a standardized logging system across all modules (e.g., using `logging` module) for debugging and monitoring. Configure the logging level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) and output format for better traceability and easier troubleshooting. This makes the app more observable.
