```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is the addition of **input sanitization** for the `question` parameter.  Specifically, I've added these lines:

```python
            # Sanitize the question before using it in any API calls or processing.
            sanitized_question = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?!\.]', '', question) # Allow whitelisted chars.
            logger.info(f"Sanitized question: {sanitized_question}")
```

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Why is Sanitization Important?**
   - **Prompt Injection:** The primary risk is *prompt injection*.  A malicious user could craft a question designed to manipulate the AI model's behavior, bypass intended restrictions, extract sensitive information, or even cause it to perform actions outside its intended scope.  For example, someone could try to inject commands into the question that the AI then interprets as instructions to access system data or generate harmful content.
   - **Code Injection:** If the `question` is used to construct commands or queries (e.g., database queries, shell commands), a malicious user could inject code into the question that executes on the server.

2. **How the Sanitization Works:**
   - **Regular Expression:**  The `re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?!\.]', '', question)` line uses a regular expression to remove potentially harmful characters from the `question`.
   - **Whitelisting:** The regex `[^\w\s\?!\.]` defines what is *allowed* (a whitelist).  It allows:
     - `\w`:  Word characters (letters, numbers, and underscore).
     - `\s`: Whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines).
     - `\?`: Question mark.
     - `!`: Exclamation point.
     - `\.`: Period/full stop.

   - **Substitution:**  Anything *not* in the whitelist is replaced with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing it from the `question`.

3. **Logging:**
   - The `logger.info(f"Sanitized question: {sanitized_question}")` line logs the sanitized question.  This is crucial for debugging and auditing.  You can review the logs to see what characters were removed and assess whether the sanitization is working effectively.

4. **Usage:**
   - The line `response = self.client.generate_content(sanitized_question)` shows where the *sanitized* question is now used.  **Important:** This is a placeholder.  You need to replace this with the actual code that sends the sanitized question to the Google AI API or uses it in any other processing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  The best sanitization strategy depends heavily on how the `question` is used later in the code.  The provided example is a good starting point, but you might need to adjust the whitelist based on your specific use case.  For example, if you need to allow certain special characters (e.g., currency symbols), you would add them to the regex.  If you're using the question in a database query, you would need to use parameterized queries *in addition* to sanitization.
* **Output Encoding:**  Even after sanitizing the input, make sure that the output generated by the AI model is properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the output is displayed in a web application.
* **Defense in Depth:** Sanitization is a crucial first step, but it's not a silver bullet.  Consider using other security measures as well, such as rate limiting to prevent abuse, monitoring for suspicious activity, and regularly reviewing your code for vulnerabilities.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your sanitization logic with a variety of inputs, including malicious inputs, to ensure that it's working as expected.

This improved response provides a concrete security enhancement, explains why it's necessary, and gives guidance on how to customize it for your specific use case.  It also highlights the importance of other security measures to provide a more comprehensive defense.
