# Configuration Update

**File**: `./tests/test_main.py`  
**Time**: 23:48:32  
**Type**: configuration_update

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

BASE_URL = "http://test"  # Extracted configuration value

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url=BASE_URL) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url=BASE_URL) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Extracted `BASE_URL`:** The `base_url` value `"http://test"` was identified as a configuration value and extracted into a constant variable `BASE_URL` at the top of the file.
2. **Replaced Inline Value:**  The hardcoded `"http://test"` was replaced with the `BASE_URL` variable in both test functions.

**Why this is better:**

* **Readability:**  The code is now easier to read and understand.  The purpose of `"http://test"` is immediately clear.
* **Maintainability:**  If you need to change the base URL, you only need to modify it in one place (the `BASE_URL` definition).  This reduces the risk of errors and makes updates easier.
* **Configuration:**  This is a very basic form of configuration.  You could easily extend this by reading the `BASE_URL` from an environment variable, a configuration file, or a command-line argument, making the tests even more flexible.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoids repeating the same string literal multiple times.
