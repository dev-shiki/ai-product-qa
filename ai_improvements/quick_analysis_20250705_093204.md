**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure, I suggest two improvements:

1.  **Introduce a linter and formatter.**  Adding tools like `flake8` and `black` would enforce consistent code style across all 21 files. This improves readability and reduces stylistic inconsistencies, leading to easier collaboration and fewer code review comments.

2.  **Add CI/CD.**  Automate testing using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).  This runs your 8 test files on every commit, preventing regressions and providing immediate feedback on code changes. This saves time and ensures the codebase stays healthy.
