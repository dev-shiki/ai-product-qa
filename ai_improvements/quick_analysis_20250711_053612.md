## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:** Use a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black` to ensure consistent code style across all 29 files. This improves readability and reduces stylistic disagreements. Integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Increase Test Coverage:**  With 8 test files for 21 source files, consider expanding test coverage, particularly around critical logic in modules like `app/api/products.py`. Aim for branch coverage to ensure robustness.
