## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Combine the `/health` endpoint's return value into the `/` endpoint.

**Improved Code:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products",
            "status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code had separate endpoints for `/` (root) and `/health`.  Since the `/health` endpoint simply returned a status and version, this information can be easily merged into the root endpoint's response.  This reduces the number of HTTP requests needed to get basic status information about the API. While seemingly minor, reducing even a single request can improve overall performance, especially under heavy load, by simplifying the routing and processing. This change improves maintainability as all basic information is now in a single endpoint.
