**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider a linter/formatter:** Utilize tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This improves readability and maintainability, especially with multiple files.

2.  **Review test coverage:** With 8 test files covering 21 Python files, analyze the test coverage reports (e.g., using `coverage.py`).  Ensure critical functionalities in `main.py`, `queries.py`, and `products.py` are adequately tested. Aim for high coverage in core logic to prevent regressions.
