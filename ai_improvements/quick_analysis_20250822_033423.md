**Time**: 03:34:23  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Consider using a linter and formatter:** With 21 Python files, maintaining consistent code style can be challenging. Implement a linter (like Flake8 or pylint) and a formatter (like Black or autopep8) to automatically enforce code style guidelines, improving readability and reducing potential errors.

2.  **Evaluate test coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, there's a possibility of insufficient test coverage. Analyze coverage reports (e.g., using `coverage.py`) to identify areas with low coverage and prioritize writing tests for critical functionalities, especially within the core `app` directory.
