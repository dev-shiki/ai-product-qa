**Time**: 11:44:54  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:** Extract application settings from hardcoded values in `.py` files into a centralized configuration (e.g., using environment variables or a dedicated config file). This enhances maintainability, portability, and allows for easier adjustments across different environments (dev, staging, production).

2. **Test Coverage and Structure:** Aim for higher test coverage. While 8 test files are good, prioritize testing critical business logic and API endpoints. Refactor tests for readability and maintainability, potentially using fixtures for common setup tasks. Consistent naming conventions for test files can also improve organization.
