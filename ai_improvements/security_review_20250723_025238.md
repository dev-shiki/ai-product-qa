```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = 'utf-8'  # Add encoding

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The added improvement is including the `env_file_encoding = 'utf-8'` to the `Config` class within the `Settings` class.

**Why this is a security improvement:**

* **Handles Different Encodings:**  By specifying the encoding of the `.env` file, you ensure that the settings are loaded correctly, regardless of the character encoding used in the file.  Without specifying an encoding, the system defaults to the system's default encoding, which can be problematic if the `.env` file uses a different encoding (e.g., UTF-8).  This can lead to unexpected errors, misinterpretation of characters in secrets (like API keys), or even denial-of-service if the application crashes due to encoding issues.  Specifying UTF-8 is generally a safe and standard practice, as it can handle a wide range of characters.  This mitigates risks associated with incorrect interpretation of sensitive configuration data. It's important to pick an encoding that matches the *actual* encoding of your .env file.  UTF-8 is the most common and recommended encoding for such files.
