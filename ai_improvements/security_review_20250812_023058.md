**Security Improvement:**

*   **Input Sanitization (XSS Prevention):**  The `bleach.clean()` function is used to sanitize the `keyword` and `search` parameters in the `search_products` and `get_products` methods, respectively. This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:** If the `keyword` or `search` parameters, which are user-provided inputs, are directly used without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. This code could then be executed in the context of a user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

2.  **`bleach` Library for Sanitization:** The `bleach` library is a well-regarded Python library specifically designed for sanitizing HTML. It removes or escapes potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes, preventing the injected JavaScript from being executed.

3.  **Implementation:**
    *   In the `search_products` method, `sanitized_keyword = bleach.clean(keyword)` sanitizes the keyword before it's used in the `local_service.search_products` call.
    *   In the `get_products` method, `sanitized_search = bleach.clean(search)` sanitizes the search term when the `search` parameter is used.

By sanitizing user inputs, we significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in the `ProductDataService`.

**Why this is the BEST single improvement:**

XSS is a very common and impactful vulnerability.  Data services often directly handle user-provided input, making them a prime target.  Sanitizing input is a simple and highly effective way to mitigate XSS risks. While other improvements are possible (rate limiting, authentication, authorization), sanitization provides the most immediate and crucial security benefit in this particular code snippet.
