## Improvement

```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.ai_service import AIService
import re

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()
ai_service = AIService()

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    products: List[dict]
    question: str
    note: str

@router.post("/ask", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def ask_question(request: QueryRequest):
    """Ask a question about products and get recommendations"""
    try:
        # Get AI response
        try:
            ai_response = await ai_service.get_response(request.question)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Error getting AI response:")  # Log the full exception
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to get AI response: {str(e)}")

        # Get relevant products and fallback message
        # Ekstrak kategori dan max_price dari pertanyaan (sederhana)
        category = None
        max_price = None

        # Deteksi kategori dengan lebih lengkap
        question_lower = request.question.lower()
        category_mapping = {
            'laptop': ['laptop', 'notebook', 'komputer'],
            'smartphone': ['smartphone', 'hp', 'handphone', 'phone', 'telepon', 'ponsel'],
            'tablet': ['tablet', 'ipad'],
            'headphone': ['headphone', 'earphone', 'headset', 'audio'],
            'kamera': ['kamera', 'camera', 'fotografi'],
            'audio': ['audio', 'speaker', 'sound'],
            'tv': ['tv', 'televisi'],
            'drone': ['drone', 'quadcopter'],
            'jam': ['jam', 'watch', 'smartwatch']
        }

Key improvements in error handling:

* **Specific `try...except` block for AI Service call:**  A dedicated `try...except` block is added around the `ai_service.get_response()` call.  This isolates the error handling to specifically address failures when interacting with the AI service.
* **Logging with `logger.exception()`:** Instead of just logging a generic message, `logger.exception()` is used inside the `except` block. This crucial improvement logs the **full stack trace** associated with the exception, providing significantly more information for debugging and identifying the root cause of the problem.  Without the full stack trace, it can be very difficult to figure out where the error actually originated.
* **Raise HTTPException with informative details:**  Inside the `except` block, `HTTPException` is raised with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) and a `detail` message that includes the string representation of the exception (`str(e)`).  This ensures that the client receives a clear error response indicating that something went wrong on the server side and *includes the specific error message* from the underlying exception, which is extremely helpful for debugging.  Wrapping the original exception details in the `detail` field avoids exposing potentially sensitive internal information directly while still providing useful diagnostic data.

Why these changes are important:

* **Robustness:** The code is now more resilient to failures in the AI service.  If the AI service is temporarily unavailable or encounters an error, the API will return a meaningful error message instead of crashing or returning an unhelpful response.
* **Debuggability:** The detailed logging and informative error responses make it much easier to diagnose and fix problems.  The full stack trace in the logs pinpoints the exact location of the error, and the error message passed to the client provides clues about the nature of the problem.
* **User Experience:**  A well-defined error response improves the user experience by providing clear feedback when something goes wrong. The user is informed that there's a server-side issue and can try again later or contact support.  A generic or crashing API provides a very poor experience.

This improved error handling makes the API more robust, easier to debug, and provides a better experience for clients.  Remember to handle other potential exceptions in other parts of the code for complete protection.
