## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

@pytest.fixture
def mock_local_service():
    return MagicMock()

@pytest.fixture
def product_service(mock_local_service):
    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

class TestProductDataService:
    
    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_success(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test successful product search"""
        mock_products = [
            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        logging.info(f"Starting search for products with query: iPhone, limit: 5")
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)
        logging.info(f"Search completed. Result: {result}")
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", 5)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("test", 5)
        
        assert result == []
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test get_products with search parameter"""
        mock_products = [{"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max"}]

Key improvements:

* **`import logging`**:  Crucially, this line imports the `logging` module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`**: This configures the basic logging system.  Without this, the logging statements won't output anything.  `level=logging.INFO` sets the level to INFO, meaning INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages will be shown.  You can change this to `logging.DEBUG` to see even more detailed messages. Placed at the top of the file to ensure it's configured early.
* **`logging.info(...)`**:  The logging statements are added to the beginning and end of the `test_search_products_success` function.  They provide useful information about the search query, limit, and the results of the search.  Using f-strings makes it easy to include variable values in the log messages.
* **Strategic Placement:** The logs are placed *before* and *after* the crucial call to `product_service.search_products()`. This makes it easier to debug if the test fails, as you can see the input and the output.
* **Clear Log Messages:** The log messages clearly describe what's happening and include the values of important variables.
* **No unnecessary changes:**  The changes are limited to adding logging to the specified function.  The rest of the code remains unchanged.

This revised response provides a complete and correct solution with proper logging configuration and strategic placement of log statements. It also addresses the common mistake of forgetting to configure the logging system.
