**Time**: 07:38:30  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter (e.g., Black and Flake8).** Consistent code style across 21 files will significantly improve readability and maintainability. This reduces cognitive load and the likelihood of introducing errors during development and future updates.

2.  **Focus on code organization, particularly around `app/api`.** Explicitly define and document the API's structure. Consider using a framework like Flask or FastAPI to streamline API endpoint definitions, request handling, and response serialization. This will make the API more robust and easier to extend.
