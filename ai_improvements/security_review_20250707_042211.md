**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The primary security concern is potential injection attacks via the `question` parameter in the `test_ask_question` function.  An attacker could craft a malicious question designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying `ai_service` or `product_service` if the input isn't properly handled.

**Implementation:**

*   **Input Sanitization:**  The improved code includes a `sanitized_question` variable.  Before sending the question to the API, it removes characters that are not alphanumeric or whitespace.  This is a basic example of input sanitization. A more robust approach would involve using a dedicated sanitization library (e.g., `bleach` for HTML, or other appropriate libraries depending on the expected input format and potential attack vectors) to escape or remove potentially harmful characters.

**Why this helps:**

*   **Prevents Simple Injection Attacks:** By removing potentially malicious characters, this measure prevents basic injection attacks where an attacker tries to inject code (e.g., SQL, command-line instructions) into the question.
*   **Reduces Attack Surface:**  Sanitization reduces the attack surface by limiting the types of input that the API needs to handle.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Robust Sanitization:**  The example sanitization is very basic.  For real-world applications, you should use a robust sanitization library tailored to the expected input and potential vulnerabilities of the AI and product services.
*   **Contextual Sanitization:** The type of sanitization needed depends on how the `question` is used by the backend services. If the question is used to query a database, then SQL injection is a concern. If it's used to execute system commands, then command injection is a concern.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Sanitization is just one layer of defense. You should also implement other security measures, such as input validation, output encoding, and least privilege principles.
*   **Escaping is preferable to stripping:**  Where possible, it's preferable to *escape* potentially dangerous characters rather than stripping them entirely.  Stripping can change the meaning of the input, whereas escaping preserves the original meaning while preventing the injection.

By implementing input sanitization, you significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks and improve the overall security of your application. Remember to choose a sanitization method that is appropriate for the specific context and potential vulnerabilities.
