# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:35:08  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Introduce Linting and Formatting:** With 21 files, enforcing a consistent code style becomes crucial. Implement a linter (like flake8) and a formatter (like Black or autopep8). This will improve readability and reduce stylistic inconsistencies across the project. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Assess Test Coverage:** While 8 test files exist, ensure they provide adequate coverage of the codebase, especially core functionalities in `app/main.py` and `app/utils/config.py`. Use a coverage tool (like `coverage.py`) to measure and identify areas lacking sufficient testing. Target for at least 80% coverage.
