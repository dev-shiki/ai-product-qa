**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions based on the provided project details:

1.  **Enforce consistent code style:** Implement a linter (like Flake8) and a formatter (like Black) to ensure code consistency across all 21 Python files. This will improve readability and maintainability, especially within a larger team or as the project grows.

2.  **Consider utilizing a more comprehensive test framework:** While 8 test files are a good start, evaluate the use of pytest for enhanced test discovery, fixtures, and improved reporting. Also, strive for higher test coverage across all modules, especially the core `app/models` components, to catch potential bugs early.
