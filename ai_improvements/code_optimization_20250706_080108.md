## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Instead of catching a generic `Exception` and then converting it to a string within the `HTTPException`, catch specific exceptions that `product_service` might raise and provide more informative and targeted error messages.

**Explanation:**

Currently, the `try...except` blocks catch *any* exception that occurs within the `product_service` calls. This is a very broad catch, and the error message passed to the client is simply the string representation of the exception.

By catching specific exceptions that you anticipate the `product_service` might raise (e.g., `NotFoundError`, `DatabaseError`, `InvalidInputError`), you can:

1.  Provide more **informative error messages** to the client, helping them understand the cause of the error and how to resolve it.  For example, instead of a generic "Database connection error," you can provide "Failed to connect to the database: [specific error details]".
2.  Handle different types of exceptions differently.  You might want to log certain errors for debugging purposes, or return different HTTP status codes based on the type of error.
3.  Avoid masking errors that you did not anticipate, and which might need to be handled by a global exception handler.

**Example (Hypothetical):**

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService, ProductNotFoundError  # Added ProductNotFoundError
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except ProductNotFoundError as e:  # Catch specific exception
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Products not found.") # More user-friendly message
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This is a basic example.  The specific exceptions you catch will depend on the implementation of your `ProductDataService`. This approach provides more robust error handling and a better user experience.
