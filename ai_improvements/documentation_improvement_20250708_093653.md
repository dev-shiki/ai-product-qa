    Tests the /health endpoint to ensure the application is running and healthy.

    This test sends a GET request to the /health endpoint and asserts that:
        - The response status code is 200 (OK).
        - The response JSON contains a "status" key with the value "healthy".
        - The response JSON contains a "version" key with the value "1.0.0".
