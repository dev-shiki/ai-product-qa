# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:07:08  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions:

1.  **Increase test coverage:**  With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, test coverage is likely low. Prioritize writing tests for core functionality and critical business logic in `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`.  Aim for a minimum code coverage percentage, and track it with tools like `pytest-cov`.

2.  **Enforce style consistency:**  Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` to maintain a consistent code style across all files. This improves readability, reduces errors, and simplifies collaboration. Integrate these tools into your development workflow.
