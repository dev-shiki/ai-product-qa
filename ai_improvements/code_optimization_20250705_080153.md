# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Use `json.dumps(mock_json_data)` instead of relying on a file and `json.load` within the tests, and consider using `@pytest.fixture(scope="session")` to run it once per session.

**Explanation:**

The most immediately impactful optimization is to avoid reading the JSON data from a file on disk repeatedly for each test.  Instead, embed the JSON data directly into the fixture (as it already is) and use `json.dumps` to convert it to a string if necessary for the mocked file operations within the tests. This removes the I/O overhead, which can be significant if you have many tests.  Additionally, using `@pytest.fixture(scope="session")` makes sure to run this one time rather than repeatedly for each function.
