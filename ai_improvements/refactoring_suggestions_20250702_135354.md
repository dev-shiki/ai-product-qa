## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

    def model_post_init(self, __context) -> None:
        """Validates the Google API Key after model initialization."""
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")


@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of Refactoring Improvement:**

The original code performed validation of the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` within the `__init__` method.  This is not the intended use case for the `__init__` method in Pydantic models (especially when using `BaseSettings`).  Pydantic provides specific methods to perform validation *after* the model has been initialized from environment variables, files, etc.

The improved code replaces the manual validation in `__init__` with the `model_post_init` method.  This is a method provided by Pydantic that gets called *after* the model has been initialized, making it the correct place to perform validation that relies on the values set by the settings loading process.

*   `model_post_init(self, __context) -> None:` This method is called after the `Settings` object has been initialized.  The `__context` argument is for internal Pydantic use and should be ignored in this case.

This approach leverages Pydantic's built-in mechanisms for post-initialization validation, making the code more robust and maintainable. It aligns better with Pydantic's intended usage patterns for settings validation.

Using `model_post_init` ensures that the validation occurs at the appropriate time and leverages the framework's capabilities.
