# Code Optimization

**Type**: code_optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Remove the docstring if it's truly just a placeholder.

**Explanation:**

If the docstring `"""Utility modules for the application."""` doesn't provide any *meaningful* information beyond the obvious, it's adding unnecessary overhead (however small).  Docstrings are good, but only when they *actually document* something useful.  If it's just a default or placeholder and isn't going to be expanded, removing it reduces the code size (negligible, but still a micro-optimization) and removes potentially misleading or outdated information if the purpose of the utility modules ever changes.

If the module docstring *does* get used by a tool that processes the module's documentation, leave it in, expanding it with relevant information to maximize the documentation's value.
