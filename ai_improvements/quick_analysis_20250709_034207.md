## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a clear module structure:** Enforce stricter organization within the `app` directory. Subdirectories beyond `api` might improve maintainability. Use explicit relative imports within the app to avoid ambiguity (e.g., `from .. import models`).

2.  **Increase test coverage:** With 8 test files and 21 Python files, ensure your core logic in each module is thoroughly tested. Aim for high statement and branch coverage, especially for critical modules like `products.py`, to minimize regressions and bugs. Consider using a coverage tool to assess current levels.
