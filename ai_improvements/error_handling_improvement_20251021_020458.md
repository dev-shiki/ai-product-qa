Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception()`:**  Instead of `logger.error()`, I've used `logger.exception()` in all `except` blocks. This is crucial. `logger.exception()` logs the entire exception information, including the traceback.  The traceback is essential for debugging because it shows the exact sequence of calls that led to the error. Without it, you only know *that* an error occurred, but not *where* or *why*.

* **Contextual Logging:** I've enhanced the logging messages to include the values of relevant variables (e.g., `keyword`, `limit`, `category`, `search`) in the error messages. This provides valuable context when debugging.  Knowing the exact parameters used when the error occurred significantly speeds up troubleshooting.

* **Fallback Error Handling:**  In `get_products`, the `local_service.get_products(limit)` call within the `except` block is now enclosed in its own `try...except` block. This is crucial because the fallback mechanism itself could fail.  If the fallback fails, a `logger.critical` message is logged and an empty list is returned. This prevents cascading failures. The `critical` level is used because the primary and fallback methods have both failed, representing a severe problem.

* **`await` added:**  The calls to `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` in `get_products` were missing the `await` keyword.  This would cause the coroutines to be returned instead of executed, leading to unexpected behavior.  I've added `await` to these calls.

* **Explicitly returning empty list:**  In all `except` blocks that are expected to return a list, an empty list (`[]`) is now explicitly returned. This ensures consistency in the return type even when errors occur.

Why these changes are important:

* **Faster Debugging:**  The traceback provided by `logger.exception()` allows you to quickly pinpoint the source of the error. The added contextual logging helps you understand the conditions under which the error occurred.
* **Robustness:** Handling exceptions gracefully, even in fallback mechanisms, makes the code more resilient to errors.  The fallback mechanism prevents complete failure and provides a degraded but functional experience.
* **Maintainability:**  Clear and informative error messages make the code easier to maintain and debug in the long run.  Explicitly handling all potential exceptions makes the code more predictable.
* **Correctness:**  The addition of `await` ensures the functions are actually executed, fixing a potential logical error.

This revised code provides significantly improved error handling, making it more robust, maintainable, and easier to debug.
