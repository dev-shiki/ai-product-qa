## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** Use tools like Flake8 and Black to enforce consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability, reduces potential errors, and simplifies collaboration. Integrate these into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.

2.  **Improve test coverage and organization:** While 8 test files exist, analyze the current test coverage. Consider a testing framework like pytest. Organize tests into logical groups mirroring your application structure, making them easier to maintain and understand.
