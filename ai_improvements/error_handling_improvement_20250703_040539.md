## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}") # Fail the test with a descriptive message

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}") # Fail the test with a descriptive message

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This is the core of the improvement.  It checks the HTTP status code of the response.  If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `HTTPStatusError`. This is *crucial* for catching server-side problems that would otherwise be silently missed by just checking `response.status_code == 200` later.
* **`try...except HTTPStatusError`:** The `raise_for_status()` call is wrapped in a `try...except` block.  This allows us to gracefully handle the `HTTPStatusError` exception if it occurs.
* **`pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")`:** Inside the `except` block, instead of just letting the exception propagate (which might be hard to trace), we use `pytest.fail()`. This explicitly marks the test as failed *and* provides a clear, informative message in the pytest output, including the details of the HTTP error. This makes debugging much easier. The `f-string` formatting includes the actual exception message for maximum clarity.

Why this is better error handling:

* **Catches Server Errors:**  The original code only checked for a 200 OK status.  If the server returned a 500 Internal Server Error, a 404 Not Found, or any other error code, the original code would *not* have detected it.  The test would incorrectly pass or fail on an unrelated assertion.  The improved code catches these server-side errors.
* **Clear Failure Messages:** When a test fails due to an HTTP error, the `pytest.fail()` message provides specific details about the error, making it much easier to diagnose the problem (e.g., "Request failed: 404 Not Found").
* **Robustness:**  The code is more resilient to unexpected server behavior.
* **Readability:** The `try...except` block clearly indicates where error handling is taking place.
* **Specificity:**  We catch *only* `HTTPStatusError`, which is the specific error we're interested in handling in this context.  This avoids accidentally catching other unrelated exceptions.

This improved version makes the tests significantly more reliable and easier to debug.  It correctly handles a wider range of possible server responses and provides much better information when things go wrong.
