# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/models/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 03:50:52  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging to. I need the code of the function to be able to add logging statements.

For example, if you provide:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y
```

I can return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")
  return result
```

**Explanation of the example:**

*   **`import logging`**: Imports the `logging` module.
*   **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`**: Configures basic logging.  `level=logging.INFO` sets the logging level to INFO, meaning INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages will be logged. You can change this level to `DEBUG` to see more detailed logging.
*   **`logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")`**: Logs an informational message at the start of the function, indicating what's being added.  This uses an f-string for easy variable insertion.
*   **`logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")`**: Logs an informational message before returning, showing the result of the addition.

**Provide me with the function you want to add logging to, and I will tailor the logging statements appropriately.**  I can add different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) based on what's happening in the function and what you want to track.
