## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:** Utilize a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a code formatter like `black` to maintain consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability and reduces potential errors. Include these tools in your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve Testing Structure:**  A ratio of roughly 1/3 test files is a good starting point. Review your test coverage, use tools like `pytest-cov` to measure it, and ensure tests thoroughly cover core logic, especially in `app/models/product.py`. Consider adding integration tests if they're missing.
