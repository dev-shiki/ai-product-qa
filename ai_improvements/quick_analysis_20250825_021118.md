# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:11:18  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a Linter:** Use a linter like Flake8 or Pylint to enforce consistent code style across all 21 files. This will improve readability and maintainability by catching common errors and style violations automatically.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** With only 8 test files covering 21 source files, test coverage is likely low. Prioritize writing more unit and integration tests, especially for critical components in files like `queries.py` and `products.py`. Aim for a coverage target of at least 80%.
