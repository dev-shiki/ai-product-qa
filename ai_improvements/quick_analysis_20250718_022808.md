# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:28:08  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1. **Consistent Naming & Structure:** Review file naming conventions for consistency (e.g., `product.py` vs. `Product.py`). Standardize the directory structure, perhaps using a `src` directory for the main application code instead of just `app`. This improves readability and maintainability, especially as the project grows.

2. **Improve Test Coverage:**  Having 8 test files alongside 21 Python files doesn't automatically guarantee good coverage.  Use a coverage tool (like `coverage.py`) to identify untested code paths. Focus tests on critical functionalities, complex logic, and edge cases, ensuring the code behaves as expected.
