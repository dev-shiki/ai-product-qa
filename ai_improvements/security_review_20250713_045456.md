**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The primary security improvement implemented is adding `exc_info=True` to the `logger.error` calls. This is a crucial practice for debugging and security.

*   **`exc_info=True` in `logger.error()` calls:**  This flag tells the logger to include the full exception information, including the traceback, in the log message.  Without this, you only get the error message string, which might not be enough to pinpoint the root cause of a problem, especially when dealing with complex exceptions or chained exceptions.  This is *extremely* important for diagnosing and fixing security vulnerabilities.  A vague error message might mask a serious injection flaw, authentication bypass, or other critical issue. The traceback shows exactly where the error occurred, making it easier to identify the vulnerable code and how it was triggered.

**Further Explanation and Additional Improvements**

1.  **Consistent `await` usage:** The original code was missing `await` keywords in some branches of the `get_products` method. For example, the calls to `self.get_products_by_category` and `self.get_all_products` were not awaited, which would lead to unexpected behavior and potentially unhandled exceptions.  These have been added.  This ensures that asynchronous operations are correctly handled, and the code waits for the results before proceeding.

2.  **Explicit Asynchronous Calls for all `local_service` calls:** To maintain consistency with `async` nature of the code, `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` methods were added that call corresponding synchronous methods in `local_service` wrapped into asyncio executor.

3. **Improved Exception handling for added methods:** The newly added methods also have proper exception handling with the inclusion of `exc_info=True` in the logger statement.

**Why this is a security improvement:**

*   **Better Debugging:**  Detailed error logs are essential for tracking down security vulnerabilities. When an attack occurs or a security-related error happens, you need to understand exactly what happened, where it happened in the code, and the state of the system at that time. `exc_info=True` provides this information.
*   **Faster Response to Incidents:**  When a security incident is detected, you need to quickly analyze the logs to understand the scope of the attack and how to mitigate it.  The more information you have in the logs, the faster you can respond to the incident.
*   **Identifying Underlying Issues:**  Sometimes, security vulnerabilities are caused by subtle bugs or unexpected behavior in the code. Detailed error logs can help you identify these underlying issues and prevent them from being exploited.
*   **Code maintainability:** Consistent `await` usage makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain, which indirectly improves security by reducing the likelihood of introducing new vulnerabilities.

By adding `exc_info=True`, you drastically improve the observability of your application, which is a key security best practice.  It lets you see *exactly* what's going wrong, instead of just getting a vague error message. This makes debugging security problems much easier and faster.
