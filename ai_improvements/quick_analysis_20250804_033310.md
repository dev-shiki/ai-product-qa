## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Implement a linter and formatter.** Use tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, and `black` to enforce consistent coding style and catch potential errors. This improves code readability and maintainability. Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks on every commit.

2. **Increase test coverage and utilize code coverage tools.** A 8/21 (approximately 40%) test-to-source file ratio is a good start, but strive for higher code coverage within each test file. Tools like `pytest-cov` can help identify untested lines of code and guide you to write more comprehensive tests, improving code reliability.
