**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is the addition of input sanitization using the `bleach` library.  Specifically, the `keyword` and `search` parameters within the `search_products` and `get_products` methods are now sanitized using `bleach.clean()`.

**Reasoning:**

* **Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Without sanitization, the `keyword` and `search` parameters could be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS) or potentially even SQL injection if `LocalProductService.search_products` directly constructs database queries from the input).  An attacker could inject malicious code (HTML, JavaScript, or SQL commands) into these parameters, which could then be executed within the application's context.

* **`bleach` for Input Sanitization:** `bleach` is a library designed to sanitize HTML and prevent XSS attacks. While the context might not *seem* like it requires HTML sanitization, using `bleach.clean()` provides a defense in depth. It removes or escapes potentially harmful HTML tags, attributes, and JavaScript code. Even if the `LocalProductService` isn't *currently* directly rendering unsanitized HTML, future modifications to the application could introduce such vulnerabilities. Sanitizing the input at this layer prevents the introduction of vulnerabilities down the line. If the `LocalProductService` is interacting directly with a database `bleach` would prevent malicious code to be saved on the database.

**How the Improvement Works:**

1. **Import `bleach`:** The `import bleach` statement adds the necessary library.

2. **Sanitize Input:**  Before the `keyword` and `search` variables are used, they are passed through `bleach.clean()`. This function removes or escapes any potentially harmful content from the input string.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Ideally, sanitization should be context-aware. `bleach` offers options to configure which tags and attributes are allowed, which could be tuned based on the expected input format. For example, if you *expect* some basic HTML formatting, you can configure `bleach` to allow specific tags like `<p>`, `<b>`, etc.  However, a safer approach is to disallow all HTML unless explicitly required.

* **Escaping vs. Sanitization:** While escaping is often used, especially in template rendering, sanitization is more appropriate when you want to allow *some* HTML but prevent potentially malicious code. `bleach` provides this balance.

* **Defense in Depth:**  Input validation and output encoding are other critical security practices.  This code focuses on sanitization as a *single* improvement, but in a real-world application, all of these techniques should be used together for a robust security posture.

This change significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks by ensuring that the input used in the search functionality is safe.
