Key improvements and explanations:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`:** This is the core of the improvement.  This method, called on the `resp` object returned by `httpx`, raises an `HTTPStatusError` if the response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). This means the code will *immediately* detect a failed HTTP request and move to the `except` block. Without this, the test might proceed with assertions on potentially invalid or empty data.
* **`try...except` block:**  The code now wraps the `ac.post` or `ac.get` call and `resp.raise_for_status()` in a `try...except` block.  This allows us to gracefully handle potential errors that occur during the HTTP request.
* **`HTTPStatusError` Handling:**  The `except HTTPStatusError as e:` block specifically catches HTTP errors. It logs the error and then uses `pytest.fail()` to immediately fail the test with a helpful error message that includes the status code and the original exception message. This makes debugging much easier.
* **Generic `Exception` Handling:**  The `except Exception as e:` block catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur during the request (e.g., network errors, timeouts, JSON decoding errors).  It logs the full stack trace (using `logger.exception()`) which is critical for debugging and then fails the test.  This prevents the test from passing silently when unexpected errors occur.
* **Logging:** Uses the `logging` module to log errors.  This is good practice as it provides a record of what went wrong, even if the test fails.  Crucially, `logger.exception` captures the full stack trace, which is invaluable for debugging.  (Remember to configure your logging appropriately in your testing environment to see the logs!)
* **`pytest.fail()`:** Instead of just letting an exception bubble up (or worse, ignoring it), `pytest.fail()` explicitly marks the test as failed. This is the correct way to signal a test failure in pytest.
* **Clearer Error Messages:** The `pytest.fail()` calls include more informative error messages, making it easier to understand why the test failed. They include the status code and/or the underlying exception.
* **Consistency:**  The improved error handling is applied to all the tests that involve HTTP requests. This ensures consistent error handling across the test suite.

How to use the logging:

1.  **Configure Logging:**  In your `pytest.ini` file (or a similar configuration), add something like this:

```ini
[pytest]
log_cli = true
log_level = DEBUG
log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
```

2.  **Run Tests:**  When you run `pytest`, the log output will be displayed in the console.

This improved version makes the tests much more robust and easier to debug, handling both expected and unexpected errors gracefully.  It also provides much better feedback when errors occur.  Remember to install the `httpx` library: `pip install httpx pytest`
