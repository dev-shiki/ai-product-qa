**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Introduce Type Hints:** Add type hints to your functions and variables (e.g., using `def function(arg: str) -> int:`) in both source and test files. This enhances code readability, helps catch errors early, and improves maintainability, especially across 21 files.

2. **Centralize Configuration:** If your application uses configuration values (database URLs, API keys), consider moving them to a single configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or using environment variables) and loading them with a library like `python-dotenv`. This makes configuration management and deployment easier.
