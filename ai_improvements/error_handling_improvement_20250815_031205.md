## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
    assert "Invalid Google API Key" in str(excinfo.value) #Verifies the specific error message.
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Specific Exception Verification:**  Instead of just checking that a `ValueError` is raised, the code now *asserts that the exception message contains a specific string* (`"Invalid Google API Key"`). This is crucial for robust error handling in tests. It verifies that the *correct* type of error is being raised *and* that the error provides helpful information.  This makes the test much more resilient to accidental `ValueError` exceptions elsewhere in the `Settings` class.

* **`excinfo` Context Manager:** Using `pytest.raises` as a context manager ( `with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:` ) allows you to capture the exception object itself (in the `excinfo` variable).  This is how we can access the error message and check its contents.

* **Clearer Error Handling Logic (in the test):** This improved version explicitly checks for a specific error message, ensuring that the test is actually validating that the `Settings` class is correctly identifying and reporting an invalid API key.  If the `Settings` class logic changes to raise a `ValueError` for a different reason, this test will now fail, indicating a potential problem.

* **Why This is Better:**  The original code only verified that *some* `ValueError` was raised. This is insufficient.  If the `Settings` class were to introduce a bug where it raises a `ValueError` in an unrelated part of the constructor, the original test would still pass, masking the bug.  The improved code avoids this issue by verifying the *specific error message*. This greatly increases confidence in the test suite.

To make this work, you'll also need to modify the `Settings` class (in `app/utils/config.py`) to raise a `ValueError` with the specific message `"Invalid Google API Key"` when the API key is invalid. For example:

```python
class Settings:  # Assuming your Settings class looks something like this.
    def __init__(self, GOOGLE_API_KEY: str):
        self.GOOGLE_API_KEY = GOOGLE_API_KEY
        self.API_PORT = 8000
        if self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            raise ValueError("Invalid Google API Key")
```

This combination of a specific exception check in the test and a meaningful error message in the code is essential for robust and maintainable tests.
