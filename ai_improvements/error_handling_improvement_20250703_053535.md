```python

Data models for the application.

from typing import Optional, Union, Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError


class DataModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Base data model with improved error handling.  Subclasses should define
    their specific attributes.

        """
        Validates data against the model.  Overrides pydantic's `model_validate`
        to provide more informative error messages.

        Args:
            data: The data to validate.  Can be a dictionary or an object
                  with attributes.
            strict: Whether to enable strict validation.
            from_attributes: Whether to validate based on attributes of the
                             input object.

        Returns:
            The validated model instance.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If validation fails, with a detailed error message
                        containing field-specific errors.

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Custom `model_validate`:**  The core improvement is overriding the `model_validate` method (previously `parse_obj` in older pydantic versions, but this is now deprecated).  This allows us to intercept the `ValidationError` raised by Pydantic's validation process and re-raise it as a `ValueError` with a much more informative message.

* **Detailed Error Messages:** The `ValidationError` from Pydantic contains structured information about each error.  The improved code extracts the `loc` (location of the error, i.e., the field name), the `msg` (the error message), and the `type` of the error, and formats them into a human-readable string.  The field path is reconstructed for nested models.

* **Exception Re-raising:** The original `ValidationError` is re-raised as a `ValueError` using `raise ValueError(...) from e`.  This preserves the original exception's traceback, which is crucial for debugging.

* **Concise Error Messages:** The error messages are formatted to be as clear and concise as possible, including the field name, error message, and the type of the validation error.

* **Type Hints:** Added comprehensive type hints for clarity and maintainability.

* **Example Usage:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to use the `User` model and how the improved error handling works in practice.  It includes examples with different types of invalid data.

* **Nested Model Support:** The code now correctly handles errors in nested models by concatenating the field names in the `loc` list to create a complete field path (e.g., `address.street.number`).

* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for improved readability and includes comments explaining the purpose of each section.

* **Compatibility:** Uses `model_validate` for Pydantic v2 compatibility.

How to use it:

1. **Define your data models:** Inherit from `DataModel` and define your fields with type annotations.
2. **Validate data:** Use `YourModel.model_validate(data)` to validate your data.
3. **Handle exceptions:** Wrap the validation call in a `try...except ValueError:` block to catch validation errors.  The `ValueError` will contain a detailed error message explaining the validation failures.

This improved code provides significantly better error handling for Pydantic models, making it much easier to debug validation issues and provide informative feedback to users.  It addresses the common complaint that Pydantic's default error messages can be difficult to understand.
