## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    try:
        # Simulate a potential error (e.g., checking database connection)
        # Remove or replace with actual health check logic
        # if not database_connection_alive():  # Replace with your actual check
        #     raise Exception("Database connection failed")

        return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Health check failed:")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Health check failed: {str(e)}")
```

Key improvements in the `/health` endpoint:

* **Try-Except Block:** The code is now wrapped in a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential exceptions during the health check.
* **Specific Exception Handling (Optional but Recommended):** While a general `Exception` is caught here for simplicity, ideally, you'd catch more specific exceptions that could occur during the health check (e.g., `DatabaseError`, `TimeoutError`). This allows for more targeted error handling and reporting.
* **Logging:**  A `logging` module is now used to log any exceptions that occur during the health check.  This is crucial for debugging and monitoring the application's health in a production environment.  The `logger.exception()` method is used to log the full traceback, which is very helpful.
* **HTTPException:** Instead of just returning a generic error message, the `except` block now raises an `HTTPException` with a 500 status code (Internal Server Error) and a more informative error message. This allows the client to understand that the health check failed and why.
* **Simulated Error (Example):** The code includes a commented-out example of a potential health check, like a database connection check.  This highlights where you would insert your actual health check logic.  It also illustrates how a failure in that logic would trigger the error handling.

This revised `/health` endpoint provides much better error handling, making the application more robust and easier to debug.  The logging provides valuable information for diagnosing issues, and the `HTTPException` gives clients clear feedback about the health of the application.  Remember to replace the simulated error with your real health check logic.
