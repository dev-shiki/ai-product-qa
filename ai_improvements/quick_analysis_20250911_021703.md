**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Code Structure & Modularity:**  With 21 Python files, consider refactoring for better modularity.  For instance, if `./app/main.py` contains a lot of logic, break it down into smaller modules within the `app` directory.  This improves readability and maintainability.  Ensure `__init__.py` files properly expose only necessary functions/classes to the outside world.

2. **Testing Strategy:**  8 test files for 21 Python files seems a bit sparse. Evaluate code coverage and consider adding more tests, especially for critical modules like `app/utils/config.py`. Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions in your tests. Aim for near 100% test coverage for important modules.
