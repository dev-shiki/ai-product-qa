**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider a Linter and Formatter:** Implement a linter (like Pylint or Flake8) and a code formatter (like Black or Autopep8).  This will ensure consistent code style across all 21 files, reducing cognitive load and improving readability. Automating this process with pre-commit hooks can enforce standards on every commit.

2.  **Evaluate Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 source files, assess your test coverage.  Aim for high coverage of critical app functionality. Consider using a coverage tool (like `coverage.py`) to identify untested code paths and improve the robustness of your application.
