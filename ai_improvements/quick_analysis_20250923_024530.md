**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Introduce a linter and formatter:** With 21 Python files, code style consistency is crucial. Integrate a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black`) into your CI/CD pipeline (or pre-commit hooks). This automates code quality checks and ensures a consistent codebase, saving time on manual reviews.

2. **Increase test coverage:**  8 test files for 21 source files *might* indicate low test coverage. Analyze which modules/functions are less tested using a coverage tool (like `coverage.py`). Prioritize writing tests for core logic and complex functionalities, improving the robustness of your application and reducing the risk of regressions.
