```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    # Do not hardcode the invalid key. Check for a generic invalid condition instead.
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "invalid-key") # Use a placeholder for invalid
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="invalid-key")
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The original code hardcoded the string `"your-google-api-key-here"` as an example of an invalid API key directly within the test.  This isn't inherently a *critical* vulnerability in this specific test setup, but it's poor practice for the following reasons:

1.  **Information Leakage:**  While unlikely, if this test file were somehow exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured server or a repository leak), it could give an attacker a hint as to what constitutes an *invalid* key according to the application's logic.  Even a small clue can be helpful to an attacker.

2.  **Rigidity and Maintainability:**  The test is tightly coupled to a specific invalid string. If the application's validation logic changes (e.g., a different format is considered invalid), the test would break and require modification.  This makes the test less robust and harder to maintain.

The improved code replaces the hardcoded invalid key `"your-google-api-key-here"` with a placeholder like `"invalid-key"`. This placeholder serves to indicate that the key is intentionally invalid for the purpose of testing the exception handling. This approach avoids hardcoding any potentially sensitive or revealing information in the test file, while still verifying that the `ValueError` is raised under invalid conditions. We're testing that *an* invalid key causes the expected error, not that *this specific key* causes it.  This enhances the test's flexibility and security.
