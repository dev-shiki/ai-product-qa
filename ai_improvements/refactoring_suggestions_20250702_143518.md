## Improvement

```python
"""
Module containing utility functions and classes for the application.
"""
```

**Explanation of Refactoring:**

The original docstring `"""Utility modules for the application."""`  is vague and doesn't provide enough information about the module's purpose.

The refactored docstring `"""Module containing utility functions and classes for the application."""` is more descriptive.  It clarifies:

*   **Scope:** It explicitly states that this is a module.
*   **Content:** It mentions that the module contains both functions and classes, providing a better understanding of what to expect within the module.
*   **Purpose:** It retains the information that the module provides utility functions and classes for the broader application.

This improved docstring enhances the module's discoverability and makes it easier for other developers (including the future you) to understand its role and contents. It's a small change with a noticeable impact on code clarity and maintainability.
