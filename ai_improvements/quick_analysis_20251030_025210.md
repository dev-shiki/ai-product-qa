**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement linting and formatting:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` for consistent code style across all files. This will improve readability and maintainability, especially in a larger project. Integrate these checks into your CI/CD pipeline for automated enforcement.

2.  **Ensure comprehensive test coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, coverage might be lacking. Use a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to identify untested code paths. Aim for high coverage (ideally above 80%) to increase confidence in your code's correctness and prevent regressions.
