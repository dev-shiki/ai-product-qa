## Improvement

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

def test_product_specifications():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5
    assert spec.sold == 100
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    assert spec.color == "Hitam"

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    try:
        assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"KeyError: 'rating' not found in specifications. Specifications data: {resp.specifications}")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to fail the test

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` block:**  The assertion `assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5` is now wrapped in a `try...except` block to specifically catch `KeyError` exceptions.  A `KeyError` will occur if the `rating` key is missing from the `resp.specifications` dictionary.

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Instead of catching a general `Exception`, we catch the more specific `KeyError`. This is crucial.  It ensures we're only handling the error we *expect* (missing key) and allows other unexpected errors to propagate and be caught by other mechanisms (or crash the test, indicating a different, more serious problem).

* **Informative Error Message:** Inside the `except` block, we print a more informative error message using an f-string: `print(f"KeyError: 'rating' not found in specifications. Specifications data: {resp.specifications}")`.  This message tells us *exactly* what went wrong (the `rating` key is missing) and also provides the entire `resp.specifications` dictionary, which is invaluable for debugging.  This helps pinpoint if the specifications dictionary was constructed correctly in the first place.

* **Re-raising the Exception:**  The `raise` statement inside the `except` block is *critical*.  If we catch the `KeyError` but don't `raise` it again, the test will *incorrectly pass*.  Re-raising the exception ensures that the test fails when the expected `KeyError` occurs, indicating that the assertion failed as intended.  This is the standard pattern for handling exceptions in tests: catch the specific exception you're interested in for logging or some other side effect, then re-raise it to properly signal failure.

This improved version provides much better error handling.  It handles the specific `KeyError` that might arise, provides a helpful error message for debugging, and ensures the test fails correctly when the expected exception occurs. This helps in quickly identifying and resolving issues related to the product response specifications.
