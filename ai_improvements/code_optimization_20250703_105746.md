# Code Optimization

**File**: `./app/utils/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 10:57:46  
**Type**: code_optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Replace docstring with `pass` if the module is truly empty.

**Improved Code (Option 1):**

```python
"""
Utility modules for the application.
"""

pass
```

**Explanation:**

If the only purpose of the module is to provide an empty container with a docstring, using `pass` instead can slightly reduce memory usage.  The docstring is still stored in memory but likely consumes more space than just `pass`. While the savings are minimal, it's a good practice for truly empty utility modules, especially if you have many of them.  A docstring in an empty file might also suggest it's intended to be filled later.

**Important Note:** If you anticipate adding code to this module in the near future, keeping the docstring is perfectly fine and might be better for maintainability, as it provides context.  This optimization is only truly beneficial for genuinely empty files.

**Improved Code (Option 2 - Remove entirely):**

If the module is *truly* empty and not serving any organizational purpose at all, the best "optimization" is to remove the file entirely.  Empty files contribute nothing to the program and can create unnecessary clutter.  Only create the file if you *intend* to put something in it soon. This is generally the superior approach if Option 1 is even being considered.
