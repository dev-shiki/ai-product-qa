## Quick Insights

1. **Centralize Configuration:** With 21 Python files, managing configurations across them can become messy. Implement a configuration file (e.g., using `configparser` or `python-dotenv`) to centralize settings like database connection strings, API keys, and feature flags. This improves maintainability and reduces code duplication.

2. **Introduce Type Hints:** Adding type hints to your functions and variables will improve code readability and maintainability. It also enables static analysis tools like MyPy to catch potential errors early on. Consider gradually introducing type hints throughout your project, starting with the most complex or critical modules.
