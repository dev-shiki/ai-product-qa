## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import logging

# Configure logging (optional but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    try:
        # Simulate a potential issue that could raise an exception
        # In a real-world scenario, this could be a database connection check,
        # external API call, or other operation that might fail.
        # For demonstration purposes, let's raise an exception based on a setting.
        if settings.raise_health_check_error:  # Assuming settings.raise_health_check_error is a boolean
            raise ValueError("Simulated health check error")

        return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Health check failed: {e}")  # Log the error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Health check failed: {e}") from e # Raise HTTP exception with error detail

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling within `health_check`:**  The core improvement is wrapping the potentially problematic code within the `health_check` function in a `try...except` block. This allows the function to gracefully handle exceptions that might occur during the health check process.
* **Specific Exception Handling (Simulated):** The example now includes a simulated error condition based on `settings.raise_health_check_error`.  This makes the example more concrete. In a real application, replace this with the actual code that might fail (e.g., database connection, external API call).
* **Logging:**  The `logging` module is used to log the error message *before* raising the `HTTPException`.  This is crucial for debugging and monitoring.  It allows you to track when and why the health check is failing without just relying on the HTTP response.  I've added basic logging configuration at the top. You can customize the logging level and destination as needed.
* **HTTPException:** Instead of just returning an error message, an `HTTPException` is raised with a 500 status code (Internal Server Error) and a `detail` message describing the error. This is the *correct* way to handle errors in FastAPI endpoints, as it signals to the client that something went wrong on the server. The `from e` is important; it chains the exceptions, preserving the original stack trace for debugging.
* **Clarity and Realism:** The code now simulates a realistic health check scenario where something might actually go wrong (e.g., a database connection failure).  This makes the example more relevant to real-world applications.
* **Configuration:** The `settings.raise_health_check_error` provides a way to trigger the error for testing purposes. You'd likely replace this with a more meaningful check related to your application's health.
* **Traceback:** The `from e` clause in the `raise HTTPException` statement preserves the original exception's traceback. This is vital for debugging, as it allows you to see the complete call stack that led to the error.

How to use the improved code:

1.  **Update your `app/utils/config.py` (or wherever `settings` is defined):** Add `raise_health_check_error: bool = False` to your settings class/object and set it to `True` to test the error handling.
2.  **Run your FastAPI application.**
3.  **Access the `/health` endpoint.**

    *   If `settings.raise_health_check_error` is `False`, you should get a `200 OK` response with `{"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}`.
    *   If `settings.raise_health_check_error` is `True`, you should get a `500 Internal Server Error` response with a JSON body containing the error details (e.g., `{"detail": "Health check failed: Simulated health check error"}`). You'll also see the error logged in your console.

This improved version provides a robust and informative way to handle errors in your FastAPI application, making it easier to debug and maintain. Remember to adapt the simulated error to reflect the actual potential failure points in your health check.
