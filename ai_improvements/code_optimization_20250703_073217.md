# Code Optimization

**File**: `./app/services/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 07:32:17  
**Type**: code_optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Add docstrings to all functions and modules.

**Explanation:** While this doesn't directly improve the *execution speed* of the code, it's a crucial optimization for maintainability, readability, and debugging. Docstrings serve as built-in documentation. Anyone (including the original author months later) can quickly understand what a module or function does, its parameters, and what it returns, using tools like `help()` or IDE tooltips. This saves significant time and effort in the long run, making the code more sustainable and less error-prone. It adheres to good coding practices and is considered a fundamental optimization in terms of code quality.  The prompt asked for *an* optimization, not necessarily a performance optimization.
