**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1. **Consider a linter and formatter:** Use a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` along with a formatter like `black` or `autopep8`. This will enforce code style consistency across all 29 files (21 + 8), improving readability and reducing potential bugs.

2. **Explore using a testing framework:** Ensure your 8 test files use a proper framework (e.g., `pytest` or `unittest`). This provides structure, clear assertions, and test discovery, making your tests more robust and easier to maintain.
