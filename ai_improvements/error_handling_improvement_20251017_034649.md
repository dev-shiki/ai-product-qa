```python
import logging
from google import genai
from app.utils.config import get_settings
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class AIService:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize AI service with Google AI API"""
        try:
            settings = get_settings()
            # Use the new Google AI client
            self.client = genai.Client(api_key=settings.GOOGLE_API_KEY)
            self.product_service = ProductDataService()
            logger.info("Successfully initialized AI service with Google AI client")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Error initializing AI service")  # Log the full traceback
            raise  # Re-raise to prevent the application from continuing in an invalid state

    async def get_response(self, question: str) -> str:
        """Get AI response with product context and fallback message"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Getting AI response for question: {question}")

            # Ekstrak kategori dan max_price dari pertanyaan (sederhana)
            import re
            category = None
            max_price = None
            
            # Deteksi kategori dengan lebih lengkap (sama dengan API endpoint)
            question_lower = question.lower()
            category_mapping = {
                'laptop': ['laptop', 'notebook', 'komputer'],
                'smartphone': ['smartphone', 'hp', 'handphone', 'phone', 'telepon', 'ponsel'],

                'jam': ['jam', 'watch', 'smartwatch']
            }
            
            for cat, keywords in category_mapping.items():
                if any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in keywords):
                    category = cat
                    break

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception("Error initializing AI service")`**:  This is the crucial change.  Instead of `logger.error(f"Error initializing AI service: {str(e)}")`, we now use `logger.exception()`.  `logger.exception()` automatically logs the exception message *and* the full traceback (stack trace).  The traceback is essential for debugging because it tells you exactly where the error occurred in the code, and the chain of function calls that led to the error.  Without the traceback, you only have the error message, which may not be enough to diagnose the problem, especially with complex dependencies.  Using f-strings for the exception message is redundant when `logger.exception` is used, as it already includes the exception message.

* **`raise`**: The `raise` statement is already present, which is good.  It ensures that if the AI service fails to initialize, the application doesn't continue running in a broken state.  This is important to prevent unpredictable behavior.

Why these changes are important:

* **Comprehensive Logging:**  When an error occurs during initialization, you need as much information as possible to diagnose the issue.  The traceback provided by `logger.exception()` is invaluable for pinpointing the root cause.
* **Preventing Silent Failures:**  If initialization fails and the exception is not re-raised, the application might continue to run with a partially initialized or invalid AI service, leading to incorrect results or crashes later on. Re-raising the exception ensures that the application stops immediately, allowing you to address the underlying problem.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  While the original code included the exception message, it lacked the crucial context of the traceback.  `logger.exception()` provides a much more informative log entry.

This improved version provides significantly better error handling, making debugging and maintenance much easier.  It is critical for real-world applications.
