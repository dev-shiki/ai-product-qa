## Improvement

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_spec():
    return ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")


def test_product_specifications(sample_spec):
    assert sample_spec.rating == 4.5
    assert sample_spec.sold == 100
    assert sample_spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    assert sample_spec.color == "Hitam"

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
```

**Justification:**

The primary performance improvement is using a **fixture** to avoid redundant object creation.

*   **Original Problem:** The `test_product_specifications` function creates a `ProductSpecifications` object every time the test runs. Creating objects, especially those with many attributes, consumes time and resources.

*   **Solution:**  We use the `pytest.fixture` decorator to create a `sample_spec` fixture. This fixture initializes the `ProductSpecifications` object *once* before any tests that use it are run.  Then, we inject this fixture into the `test_product_specifications` function as an argument. Pytest automatically handles the creation and injection of the fixture.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reduced Object Creation:**  The `ProductSpecifications` object is created only once, rather than in each test run, saving time.  This is especially beneficial if the object creation is resource-intensive.
    *   **Improved Readability and Maintainability:** The tests become shorter and clearer, focusing on the assertions rather than the setup. If the `ProductSpecifications` constructor changes, you only need to update the fixture definition.
    *   **Reusability:** The fixture can be reused in other tests that require a `ProductSpecifications` object with those default values.
    *  **Encapsulation:** The fixture encapsulates the object creation logic, making the test code cleaner and easier to understand.

This approach follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, leading to more efficient and maintainable tests.  While the performance gain might be negligible for a small number of tests, it becomes significant as the test suite grows and becomes more complex.
