## Quick Insights

Given the structure (likely a web application with an API), here are two quick improvements:

1. **Consistent Error Handling:** Implement centralized error handling, possibly using a dedicated module. Instead of scattered `try-except` blocks, create custom exceptions and a middleware or function to handle them gracefully, returning consistent error responses from the API. This improves code readability and maintainability.

2. **Introduce a Linter/Formatter:** Ensure consistent code style across all files. Employ a linter (like `flake8`) and a formatter (like `black`) to automatically enforce style guides. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline to prevent style issues from being merged.
