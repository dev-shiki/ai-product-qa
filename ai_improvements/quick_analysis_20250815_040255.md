# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 04:02:55  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Implement a clear project structure:** While 21 files isn't massive, consistent organization aids maintainability. Ensure `app/api/` follows a logical pattern (e.g., REST resource folders) and `main.py` acts as a central entry point, not a dumping ground. Review file naming conventions for clarity (e.g., `products_api.py`).

2. **Focus on Test Coverage:** With almost 1/3 of the files being tests, target high test coverage, especially for core logic in `queries.py` and `products.py`. Consider using a coverage tool to identify untested code paths and prioritize creating tests for those areas.
