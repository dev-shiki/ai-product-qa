**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Improve Test Coverage:**  With 21 Python files and only 8 test files, test coverage is likely low. Focus on increasing the number of tests, especially unit tests, to cover critical components and edge cases in your `app` directory. This will improve reliability and reduce the risk of bugs.

2.  **Enforce Code Style:** Introduce a consistent code style using a tool like Black or autopep8 and enforce it with pre-commit hooks or CI checks. This enhances readability and maintainability across all 21 files, making collaboration easier.
