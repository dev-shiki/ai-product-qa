# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_ai_service.py`  
**Time**: 02:37:55  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Test response"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        logger.info("Calling service.get_response with question: Test question")  # Log the input question
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        logger.info(f"Received response: {response}")  # Log the response received
        assert response == "Test response"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:** The code now correctly imports the `logging` module, which is essential for logging functionality.
* **Create a logger:**  `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance specific to this module.  This is the standard and best practice way to get a logger.  Using `__name__` ensures that the logs are properly attributed to the module where they originate, making debugging much easier.
* **Informative Log Messages:** The log messages now clearly indicate what's happening:
    * `"Calling service.get_response with question: Test question"`:  Logs the fact that the `get_response` method is being called and includes the actual question being passed. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the flow of execution.
    * `f"Received response: {response}"`: Logs the response received from the `get_response` method. This allows you to see the actual output of the service and verify its correctness.  Using an f-string makes it easy to include the value of the `response` variable in the log message.
* **Log Levels:**  I've used `logger.info`.  This is generally a good choice for informational messages about the program's operation. Other useful log levels include `logger.debug`, `logger.warning`, `logger.error`, and `logger.critical`.  Choose the level that best reflects the severity and importance of the message.  Consider using `logger.debug` for very detailed information that's only needed for troubleshooting.

How to use the logging:

1. **Configure Logging:** You'll need to configure the logging system (e.g., using `logging.basicConfig`) to specify where the logs should be written (e.g., to the console, to a file) and what level of messages should be included.  A basic example is:

   ```python
   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) # or logging.DEBUG for more verbose output
   ```

   Place this *before* your tests are run. A common place is in a `conftest.py` file at the root of your test directory.

2. **Run Your Tests:** When you run your tests, the logging messages will be printed to the configured output (e.g., the console).

This revised solution provides a robust and practical approach to adding logging to your test function, enabling better debugging and monitoring capabilities.  The key is to configure the logging system so that you can actually see the output of the logger.
