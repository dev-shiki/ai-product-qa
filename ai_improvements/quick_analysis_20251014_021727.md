## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Improve Code Structure:**  Consider grouping related files into subdirectories. For instance, if `queries.py` and `products.py` represent different parts of an API, further subdivide the `app/api` directory (e.g., `app/api/query`, `app/api/product`). This enhances organization and maintainability, especially as the project grows.

2.  **Implement a Testing Framework:** While tests exist, leveraging a proper testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest` offers features like test discovery, fixtures, and better reporting. This will streamline the testing process, making it more efficient and robust.
