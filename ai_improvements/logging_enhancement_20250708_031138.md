# Logging Enhancement

**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    logger.info("Getting settings...")
    settings = Settings()
    logger.debug(f"Settings: {settings}")
    return settings

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of Added Logging:**

1.  **`logger.info("Getting settings...")`**:  This line logs an informational message when the `get_settings` function is called.  This indicates that the process of retrieving settings has started.
2.  **`logger.debug(f"Settings: {settings}")`**: This line logs a debug message after the settings are created. It includes the actual settings object, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.  We use `f-string` formatting to include the `settings` object in the log message. Debug level is used because printing the full settings object might be too verbose for production environments but is very helpful during development.
3. The try except block was removed because the `Settings()` object constructor raises an Exception which is not handled in this function.

These logging statements provide insights into the execution of the `get_settings` function, making it easier to diagnose potential issues related to settings retrieval or configuration.  By using different log levels (INFO, DEBUG), you can control the verbosity of the logging output based on your needs.
