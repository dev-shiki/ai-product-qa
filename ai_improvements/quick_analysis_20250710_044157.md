# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 04:41:57  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the small project size (21 files, 8 test files), focus on maintainability and testability:

1.  **Enforce code style consistently:** Introduce a linter (like Flake8) and formatter (like Black) with pre-commit hooks. This promotes readability across the project and reduces stylistic debates.

2.  **Improve test coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage.  The ratio of 8 test files to 21 source files suggests potential gaps. Tools like `pytest-cov` can help identify uncovered lines, ensuring crucial logic in files like `products.py` is adequately tested.
