## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

@pytest.fixture
def mock_local_service():
    return MagicMock()

@pytest.fixture
def product_service(mock_local_service):
    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

class TestProductDataService:
    
    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_success(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test successful product search"""
        mock_products = [
            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", 5)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error"):
            await product_service.search_products("test", 5)
        
        # Alternatively, if you want to catch and handle the exception within the test
        # try:
        #     await product_service.search_products("test", 5)
        # except Exception as e:
        #     assert str(e) == "Test error"
        # else:
        #     pytest.fail("Expected an exception but none was raised.")
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test get_products with search parameter"""
        mock_products = [{"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max"}]

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`pytest.raises` Context Manager:**  The core improvement is using `pytest.raises`. This is the *correct* way to test for exceptions in pytest.  It elegantly verifies that the expected exception type (and optionally a message) is raised within the `with` block.  This makes the test much more precise and readable.  It also avoids the potential pitfall of code continuing to execute *after* an unexpected exception if you were just relying on `try...except`.

* **Explicit Exception Verification:**  `pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error")` makes it very clear that we expect an `Exception` and specifically one whose message matches "Test error".  This is much more robust than simply asserting `result == []`, as it guarantees that the *intended* exception occurred.

* **Alternative Catch and Assert (Commented Out):**  I've included a commented-out `try...except` block that shows how you *could* catch the exception and do assertions.  However, `pytest.raises` is generally preferred because it's more concise and pytest-idiomatic.  I kept it for illustrative purposes.  The important addition to the commented-out block is `pytest.fail("Expected an exception but none was raised.")`.  Without this, if `product_service.search_products` *doesn't* raise an exception (a failure scenario), the test would incorrectly pass, which is dangerous.

* **Why the original was flawed:**  The original `assert result == []` was problematic because:

    1.  It assumed that the only way the `result` could be `[]` is if the specific `Exception("Test error")` was raised. There could be other reasons for an empty list (e.g., the service returning an empty list when no results are found), leading to a false positive in the error case.
    2.  It didn't verify the type or message of the exception, which is crucial for ensuring you're testing the intended failure condition.

This revised version provides a much more robust and reliable test for error conditions using best practices for pytest.  Critically, it *confirms* the expected exception is raised, rather than just checking the return value, which is a much stronger and more accurate test.
