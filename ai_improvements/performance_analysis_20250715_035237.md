```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        extra = "ignore"  #  Avoids validation errors if the .env file has extra fields.


    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Justification:**

The most significant performance improvement for this specific code snippet is to add `extra = "ignore"` to the `Config` class of the `Settings` model.  Here's why:

* **Prevents Unexpected Validation Errors and Delays:**  When `pydantic-settings` loads environment variables from a `.env` file, it validates these variables against the fields defined in the `Settings` class. If the `.env` file contains extra variables that are *not* defined in the `Settings` class, pydantic will raise a `ValidationError`. While it may not cause any issues if the env file is clean, it will cause a delay when instantiating the settings. More importantly, `pydantic` could try to validate variables and crash at startup if it contains variables of the wrong type. Setting `extra = "ignore"` tells pydantic to simply ignore these extra environment variables. This prevents unnecessary validation overhead and potential exceptions.  This avoids startup crashes and delays.

By ignoring unexpected fields, the application becomes more robust to changes or additions in the `.env` file, and the `Settings` class instantiation will be faster, especially if the `.env` file is large or contains many irrelevant variables.

The other suggestions (using `functools.cached_property` and using `@dataclass` are valid but their impact will likely be less than adding `extra="ignore"` to the `Config` class.  Also, it's critical to keep the error checking in place for `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to prevent the program from running with an invalid or missing key.
