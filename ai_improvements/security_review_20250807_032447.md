```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

#  Retrieve allowed origins from environment variable for better security
ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "*")
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR != "*" else ["*"]


app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,  # Use the environment variable here
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation:**

The core security improvement is replacing the hardcoded `"*"`, which allows all origins, with a configurable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list fetched from an environment variable.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.

*   **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "*")`**: This line retrieves the value of the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. If the variable is not set, it defaults to `"*"`.
*   **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR != "*" else ["*"]`**: This line parses the string obtained from the environment variable.
    *   If the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR` is not equal to `"*"`, it means that specific origins are provided.  In this case, the string is split by commas to create a list of allowed origins.
    *   If the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR` is equal to `"*"`, it means that all origins are allowed (for development purposes maybe).  In this case, the list of allowed origins remains `["*"]`.
*   **`allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`**: This uses the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list in the `CORSMiddleware` configuration.

**Why this is more secure:**

*   **Reduced Attack Surface:**  Allowing all origins (`"*"`) is a security risk.  It means any website can make requests to your API, potentially exposing it to Cross-Origin Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, data leaks, or other malicious activities.  By specifying only the origins that you trust, you limit the scope of potential attacks.
*   **Configuration Flexibility:**  Using an environment variable allows you to change the allowed origins without modifying the code. This is crucial for deploying the application to different environments (development, staging, production), where the allowed origins might differ.  You can simply set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable appropriately for each environment.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  While CORS is not a complete security solution, it provides a valuable layer of protection.  Combined with other security measures (authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.), it contributes to a more robust security posture.

**How to use:**

1.  **Set the Environment Variable:**  Before running your application, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. For example:

    ```bash
    export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend-domain.com,https://another-trusted-domain.com"
    ```

    Or, in a `.env` file:

    ```
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend-domain.com,https://another-trusted-domain.com"
    ```

    And use a library like `python-dotenv` to load the `.env` file.

2.  **Run your FastAPI application.**  The `CORSMiddleware` will now only allow requests from the specified origins.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Deployment:** Ensure that your deployment system correctly sets the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable for each environment.
*   **Dynamic Origins:** If you need to support truly dynamic origins (e.g., subdomains), more advanced CORS configurations may be necessary, potentially involving a custom middleware.  However, carefully consider the security implications before implementing dynamic origin handling.  It's generally better to use a more restrictive and controlled approach if possible.
*   **Other Security Measures:**  CORS is just one part of a comprehensive security strategy.  You still need to implement authentication, authorization, input validation, and other security measures to protect your API.
