        final_result = result + 10  # Further operation
        logging.info(f"Exiting my_utility_function with final_result: {final_result}")  # Log exit
        return final_result
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred in my_utility_function: {e}", exc_info=True)  # Log error with traceback
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to propagate it
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially, you need to import the `logging` module.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig()` is essential.  Without it, you won't see any log output.  I've included a basic setup that logs to the console with a timestamp, log level, and message.  **Important:**  For real applications, you'll want a more sophisticated configuration (e.g., logging to files, different log levels for different modules, etc.).  Look into `logging.config` and `logging.handlers` for advanced setup.
* **`logging.info()`:**  Logs general information about the function's execution (entry and exit points, key parameters).  These are the most common log messages.
* **`logging.debug()`:**  Logs more detailed information, such as intermediate values.  Use this when you need very fine-grained tracing for debugging.  Debug level logs are typically only enabled during development or when troubleshooting.
* **`logging.error()`:**  Logs error conditions.  *Always* include exception information (`exc_info=True`) when logging errors.  This will include the traceback, which is vital for debugging.
* **`try...except` Block:**  Robust error handling.  If the function raises an exception, it's caught, logged, and then *re-raised* using `raise`. Re-raising is important so that the calling code still knows that the function failed.
* **f-strings:**  Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Entering my_utility_function with input_value: {input_value}"`) makes formatting log messages much cleaner and easier to read.
* **Clear Log Messages:**  Write log messages that are informative and easy to understand.  Include the function name, relevant variable values, and what's happening at that point in the code.
* **Log Levels:** The example uses `logging.INFO`, `logging.DEBUG`, and `logging.ERROR`. Choose appropriate log levels for different situations.  Levels, in increasing order of severity, are:  `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.

How to use and test:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging (basic example - adjust as needed for your application)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def my_utility_function(input_value):
    """
    A simple utility function that performs some operation.

    Args:
        input_value: The value to operate on.

    Returns:
        The result of the operation.
    """
    logging.info(f"Entering my_utility_function with input_value: {input_value}")  # Log entry
    try:
        result = input_value * 2  # Example operation

        logging.debug(f"Intermediate result (input_value * 2): {result}")  # Optional detailed logging

        final_result = result + 10  # Further operation
        logging.info(f"Exiting my_utility_function with final_result: {final_result}")  # Log exit
        return final_result
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred in my_utility_function: {e}", exc_info=True)  # Log error with traceback
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to propagate it


# Example usage:
try:
    result = my_utility_function(5)
    print(f"Result: {result}")

    result = my_utility_function("abc") # This will cause an error and log it.
    print(f"Result: {result}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")  # Handle any exceptions that were re-raised.
```

This complete example shows how to call the function and how to configure the logging to a level such as `logging.DEBUG` in order to show the debug level log statements in your terminal.  It also handles exceptions that may be re-raised from the function.  Run this, and you'll see log messages in your console.  Experiment with different log levels in `logging.basicConfig()` to see how the output changes.
