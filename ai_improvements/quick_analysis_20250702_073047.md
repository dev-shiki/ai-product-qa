## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Establish a Style Guide:** With 21 Python files, enforce code consistency using a style guide like PEP 8 and a linter (e.g., Flake8, pylint). This improves readability and maintainability, especially as the project grows. Include it in your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage Reporting:** Ensure your 8 test files provide adequate coverage. Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage and identify untested parts of your code. Aim for a coverage target (e.g., 80%) and add more tests for uncovered areas, especially in crucial modules like `products.py`.
