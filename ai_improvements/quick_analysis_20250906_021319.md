## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvements:

1.  **Consider a Linter:** With 21 Python files, enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early by integrating a linter like Flake8 or Pylint. This improves readability and reduces bugs. Set up pre-commit hooks for automated checks.

2.  **Improve Test Organization:** Ensure test files adequately cover functionality. Structure tests logically (e.g., by module or class). Consider using pytest for better test discovery, fixtures, and plugin support. Review test coverage reports to identify areas needing more attention.
