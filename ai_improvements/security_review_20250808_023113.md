**Security Improvement:**

*   **Response Body Validation:** Implement response body validation against a predefined schema.  This helps prevent unexpected data injection or manipulation by the mocked service.

**Explanation:**

The primary security concern in these tests, while testing, is that the mock service could be unintentionally or maliciously modified to return unexpected data.  This unexpected data, if not validated, could lead to vulnerabilities in the application when used in real-world scenarios if the tests are relied upon to confirm that the API responses conform to a specific format.

The suggested improvement addresses this by validating the structure and potentially the data types of the JSON response body.  While the code snippet doesn't include the full schema validation implementation, it suggests a starting point by checking for the presence of required fields ("id" and "name").  A more robust solution would use a schema validation library (like `jsonschema`) to enforce a comprehensive schema on the response.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures the integrity of data received from the mock service.
*   **Error Prevention:** Catches unexpected changes in data structure early, preventing potential errors or crashes in the application.
*   **Security Hardening:** Prevents data injection attacks or other malicious activities that might be possible if the response data is not properly validated.

In a real-world application, this kind of validation should be performed on all API responses, especially those that are used to populate UI elements or make critical business decisions. In this testing scenario, it hardens the confidence in the test's results by verifying the mock service responses are as expected.
