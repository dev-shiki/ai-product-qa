## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider modularization within the `app` directory.**  If your `app` directory is becoming sprawling, break down `main.py` and other large files into smaller, more focused modules.  This improves readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand the project structure and isolate changes. For example, further grouping inside `./app/api/` is probably a good way to keep the project clean.

2.  **Enforce code style consistency with a linter/formatter.**  Introduce a tool like `flake8` or `black` (or both!) with pre-commit hooks. This ensures a consistent code style across all Python files, improving readability and reducing potential style-related bugs, and makes reviewing much easier.
