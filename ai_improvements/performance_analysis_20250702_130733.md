**Justification:**

The primary performance bottleneck in Streamlit applications often lies in repeated data fetching.  The `requests.get(url)` call is likely to be executed multiple times during a single session, especially if the application reruns due to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, slider changes).

By wrapping the API call within the `fetch_data` function and decorating it with `@st.cache_data`, we instruct Streamlit to cache the result of the function.  Subsequent calls to `fetch_data` with the same `url` will retrieve the data from the cache instead of making a new API request.  This significantly reduces latency and improves the overall responsiveness of the application, especially when dealing with slow or frequently accessed APIs. `st.cache_data` is preferred over `st.cache` as it provides better type safety and is more performant in recent versions of Streamlit.  The added `try...except` block also enhances the robustness of the application by handling potential network errors during API calls.
