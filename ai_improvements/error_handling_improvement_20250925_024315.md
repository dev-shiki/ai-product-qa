```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
import logging

# Configure logging (if not already configured)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


@pytest.fixture
def mock_local_service():
    return MagicMock()

@pytest.fixture
def product_service(mock_local_service):
    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

class TestProductDataService:
    
    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_success(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test successful product search"""
        mock_products = [
            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", 5)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error"):
            await product_service.search_products("test", 5)

    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test get_products with search parameter"""
        mock_products = [{"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max"}]
        mock_local_service.get_products.return_value = mock_products
... (truncated for analysis)

Key improvements:

* **Raise the Exception instead of catching and returning an empty list:**  The original code caught the exception and returned an empty list, which can mask underlying issues.  A better approach is to let the exception propagate so the test *fails* when an error occurs, highlighting the problem.  `pytest.raises` is the correct way to assert that a specific exception is raised.  This makes debugging much easier.  The `match` argument ensures that the expected exception with the correct message is raised, preventing false positives.
* **Removed unnecessary logging:** Logging within the test itself is generally not needed, as pytest captures logs automatically.  If logging is needed, it should be done in the tested service (ProductDataService) itself.
* **Conciseness:**  Removed the `try...except` block entirely.
* **Correctness:** Ensures the test fails when the `search_products` method fails, providing more informative test results.
