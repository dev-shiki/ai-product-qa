## Quick Insights

1. **Improve modularity and maintainability:** Consider refactoring `app/main.py` to delegate core functionalities to separate modules. This will make `main.py` a clearer entry point. For example, move database connection or application setup code into dedicated modules within the `app` directory.

2. **Strengthen testing:** A ratio of roughly 4:1 code files to test files suggests potential gaps in test coverage. Focus on increasing integration and system-level tests, particularly around the API endpoints in `queries.py` and `products.py`, to ensure robust API behavior. Consider using a coverage tool to identify untested code paths.
