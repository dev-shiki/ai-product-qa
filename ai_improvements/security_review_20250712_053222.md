## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Read allowed origins from environment variable
ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "")
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [origin.strip() for origin in ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if origin.strip()]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,  # Use environment variable for allowed origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The original code used `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`. This means that any website could make requests to your API, which is a significant security risk.  It opens the door for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and other malicious activities.

The improved code addresses this by:

1. **Reading Allowed Origins from an Environment Variable:** Instead of hardcoding `allow_origins=["*"]`, the code now reads the allowed origins from an environment variable called `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. This allows you to configure the allowed origins without modifying the code itself.  This is crucial for deployment because you can easily change the allowed origins based on the environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

2. **Parsing the Environment Variable:** The code parses the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable, splitting it into a list of allowed origins.  It also strips whitespace to ensure correct matching.

3. **Using the List of Allowed Origins:** The `CORSMiddleware` now uses the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list for the `allow_origins` parameter.  This restricts access to only the origins you explicitly specify.

**How to use the improved code:**

1. **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:** Before running your application, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of allowed origins. For example:

   ```bash
   export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"
   ```

2. **Run your FastAPI application.**

Now, only requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `https://www.example.com` will be allowed by the CORS middleware. All other origins will be blocked.

**Why this is a security improvement:**

* **Defense in Depth:**  This adds a layer of security by explicitly controlling which origins can access your API.
* **Configuration Flexibility:**  Environment variables make it easy to manage configuration across different environments (development, staging, production) without changing the code.
* **Reduces Attack Surface:**  By limiting allowed origins, you reduce the potential attack surface of your application.  Malicious websites can no longer make unauthorized requests to your API.

This single change significantly improves the security of your FastAPI application by limiting Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to only trusted origins.
