## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    # Define a safe default for GOOGLE_API_KEY within the test
    safe_api_key = "test_valid_dummy_key"
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", safe_api_key)
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY=safe_api_key)
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == safe_api_key
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    # Use a clearly invalid API key for testing failure cases
    invalid_api_key = "invalid_api_key_for_testing"
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", invalid_api_key)
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY=invalid_api_key)
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security improvement is to **avoid hardcoding potentially sensitive default values directly in the test code**. In the original code, the invalid test used  `"your-google-api-key-here"` as a default.  If someone were to accidentally use this string outside of a testing context, it would create a massive vulnerability as it signals a missing and easily guessable API key.

Instead, the improved code:

1.  **Defines explicit `safe_api_key` and `invalid_api_key` variables:** These are explicitly defined within the test scope and serve as placeholder values *only* for the purpose of running the tests.  They are less likely to be mistakenly used in production code.

2.  **Clarity of Purpose:** Using names like `"invalid_api_key_for_testing"` makes it extremely clear that these are test-specific values.

This approach reduces the risk of exposing or accidentally using placeholder API keys in production environments. It emphasizes the importance of secure default settings and protects against potential vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or missing API key configurations.  It's a principle of least privilege applied to test data.  We ensure that the tests don't inadvertently create attack vectors.
