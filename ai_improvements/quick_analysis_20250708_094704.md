## Quick Insights

Given the structure (app/main.py, app/api/products.py, tests), consider these improvements:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter (like Flake8/Black):**  Enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early. This significantly improves code readability and maintainability across all 21 files.
2.  **Establish clear dependency management:** Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (with Poetry or pipenv) to explicitly define and manage project dependencies. This avoids environment-related issues and simplifies collaboration and deployment.
