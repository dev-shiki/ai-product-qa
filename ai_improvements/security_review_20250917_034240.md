## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = 'utf-8' # Specify encoding

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

        # Securely handle the API key: remove from environment after use.
        os.environ.pop("GOOGLE_API_KEY", None)


@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is:

```python
os.environ.pop("GOOGLE_API_KEY", None)
```

**Rationale:**

1. **Memory Sanitization**: The primary threat is the presence of sensitive credentials (like the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) within the program's environment variables *after* they have been read by the `Settings` class.  Other parts of the application or any external processes running within the same environment might be able to access these environment variables. Even if seemingly unused, the credentials stay present in memory until the process ends.

2. **Preventing Accidental Exposure:** By removing the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from the environment variables immediately after the `Settings` object is initialized, we significantly reduce the risk of accidental exposure.   Consider scenarios such as:

   * **Debugging/Logging:**  Logging entire environment dictionaries is a common debugging practice.  Without this sanitation step, the sensitive key would be logged, creating a potential vulnerability.
   * **Subprocesses:**  If your application launches subprocesses, these subprocesses inherit the environment of the parent process. Removing the key prevents it from being passed down.
   * **Memory Dumps:** In the event of a system crash or memory dump for debugging, the key would be present in the dump if not sanitized.

3. **`os.environ.pop()` with `None`**: We use `os.environ.pop("GOOGLE_API_KEY", None)` rather than `del os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]` to gracefully handle the case where, for some reason, the variable isn't found in the environment after initialization.  `pop()` with `None` as the second argument will not raise an error if the key is not present, making the code more robust.

**Why this specific improvement was chosen and why others were not:**

*   **.env File Handling:** While using `.env` files is generally recommended for storing configuration, they are not inherently secure, especially in production environments. If someone gains access to the server, they likely could also access the .env file. While not a complete mitigation, reading the key and then removing it from the environment improves security.
*   **Not for every key**: It's usually enough to remove the secret keys, not every variable.
*   **Not logging the settings class**: While it's a good idea to avoid logging the whole settings object, it's not the most important security improvement in this case. Logging the whole settings would require careful consideration of the other variables that might be logged.
*   **Encoding:** Including `env_file_encoding = 'utf-8'` ensures that the .env file is read correctly, especially if it contains special characters.
*   **Encryption:** While encryption of the entire .env file at rest would be *ideal*, it's a more complex change that goes beyond the single, targeted improvement requested.  This current approach is a practical step that can be easily implemented without significant code restructuring.

In summary, removing the sensitive `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from environment variables after it's been loaded into the application's settings is a focused, effective security improvement that minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.
