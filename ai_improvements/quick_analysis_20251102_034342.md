# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:43:42  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Centralize Configuration:**  Extract application-wide settings (API keys, database URLs) from the Python files into a dedicated configuration module (e.g., `config.py`).  Use environment variables to manage settings across environments (dev, prod). This makes settings easier to manage and modify without code changes.

2.  **Implement a Linter/Formatter:** Integrate a tool like `flake8` and `black` into your workflow. This will enforce consistent code style across all 21 files, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Configure pre-commit hooks to automatically run these tools before commits.
