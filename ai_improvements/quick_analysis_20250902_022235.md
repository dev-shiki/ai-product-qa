## Quick Insights

1. **Enforce Consistent Style:** With 21 Python files, consistent code style (PEP 8) is crucial. Integrate a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` into your development workflow. This will improve readability and maintainability, especially for a project of this size.

2. **Centralized Configuration:** Consolidate configuration management. Instead of scattered settings within files, leverage `config.py` or a dedicated configuration library (like `pydantic-settings`) to centralize settings with clear validation and environment variable overrides. This improves configuration management and simplifies deployment.
