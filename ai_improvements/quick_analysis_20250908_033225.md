**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Centralized Configuration:**  The `config.py` suggests a dedicated module for configuration. Consider using a library like `pydantic-settings` for structured configurations. This will promote type safety, validation, and easier management of different environments.

2.  **Test Coverage:**  With 21 Python files and only 8 test files, the test coverage might be low. Prioritize writing tests for core logic in each module, especially those in `app/utils`, to improve code reliability and maintainability. Aim for high coverage in `main.py` and critical modules.
