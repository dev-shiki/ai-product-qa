**Explanation:**

The primary security improvement implemented is **input sanitization** using the `bleach` library.  Specifically, I've added `bleach.clean()` to sanitize the `keyword` parameter in the `search_products` function and the `search` parameter in the `get_products` function *before* passing it to the `local_service.search_products()` method.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Preventing Injection Attacks:** Without sanitization, user-provided input (like the `keyword` or `search` terms) can be maliciously crafted to inject code or commands into the application. If `local_service.search_products` passes this data to a database query or system call without proper escaping or validation, it could lead to severe vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or command injection.

*   **Bleach Library:** `bleach` is used for sanitizing HTML and other potentially dangerous input.  While we don't know exactly how `local_service.search_products` uses the keyword, sanitizing it provides a general layer of defense.  It helps strip out potentially harmful HTML tags or other malicious code that a user might try to inject into the search query.

**How it works:**

1.  **`import bleach`:** Imports the `bleach` library.
2.  **`sanitized_keyword = bleach.clean(keyword)`:** Before the `keyword` is used, it's passed through `bleach.clean()`. This function removes or escapes any potentially harmful HTML tags or attributes within the keyword string, making it safer to use.
3.  **Use the Sanitized Input:** The sanitized version of the keyword (`sanitized_keyword`) is then used in the logging and passed to the `local_service.search_products` function.
4.  **`sanitized_search = bleach.clean(search)`:** Sanitizes the search term in `get_products` function.
**Alternative Considerations (depending on the implementation of `LocalProductService`):**

*   **Escaping:** If `local_service.search_products` constructs SQL queries directly, proper escaping of the keyword is *critical*. The database library you're using (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL, `sqlite3` for SQLite) will provide mechanisms for escaping user input.
*   **Parameterized Queries:**  The *best* practice is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements). Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not as part of the SQL command, effectively preventing SQL injection.
*   **Validation:** Input validation can be used *in addition* to sanitization. Validate the *format* of the `keyword` if possible (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters).  However, validation alone is not sufficient to prevent all injection attacks.

The use of `bleach.clean` is a defense-in-depth measure that adds a layer of protection against potential injection vulnerabilities by sanitizing potentially harmful input *before* it's passed to downstream functions.
