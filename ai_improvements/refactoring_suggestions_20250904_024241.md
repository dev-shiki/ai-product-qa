  return top_rated
```

**Explanation:**

The main improvement is injecting the `ProductDataService` as a dependency into the route functions using FastAPI's `Depends` feature.  This promotes loose coupling, makes testing easier, and improves the overall maintainability of the code.

Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they're beneficial:

1. **Dependency Injection with `Depends`:**

   - Instead of instantiating `product_service = ProductDataService()` at the module level, we now use `product_service: ProductDataService = Depends()` within each route's function signature.
   - `Depends()` tells FastAPI to handle the dependency injection. FastAPI will automatically create (if necessary), manage, and inject an instance of `ProductDataService` when the route is called.

2. **Benefits of Dependency Injection:**

   - **Testability:**  During testing, you can easily mock or stub `ProductDataService` and inject a test double instead of the real service. This allows you to isolate the route logic and test it independently of external data sources or complex service behavior.  Without DI, you'd have to monkey-patch or use other less clean techniques.

   - **Loose Coupling:** The route functions no longer directly depend on a concrete `ProductDataService` class.  They depend on an *abstraction* (the `ProductDataService` type hint). This means you can change the implementation of `ProductDataService` (e.g., switch to a different data source) without modifying the route functions themselves, as long as the new implementation still conforms to the `ProductDataService` interface.

   - **Maintainability:**  Changes to the `ProductDataService` are less likely to ripple through the rest of your application. This makes the code easier to maintain and evolve over time.

   - **Configuration:** You can configure the `ProductDataService` instance (e.g., with different database connection details) through FastAPI's dependency injection system.

   - **Reusability:**  The service can be used in other parts of the application.

3. **Naming convention and minor changes:**
   - The original functions that contained the business logic of each route were split into two functions:
     - The original `get_products` became `get_products` with the service dependency and `get_products_endpoint` which is the router function. This allows to reuse the logic contained within the first `get_products` and provides a more readable solution.
     - Renaming the router endpoints with a `_endpoint` suffix allows for an easier understanding of the code and separates clearly each part.

4. **Handling `search_products` parameters.**
   - Passing the `query` and `limit` to the underlying logic instead of defining them again ensures that the parameters are correctly used within the service.
     - `async def search_products_endpoint(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10, search_result: dict = Depends(search_products)):`

**In summary:** Dependency injection is a fundamental design principle that significantly improves the quality of code.  Using `Depends` in FastAPI is a simple and effective way to achieve dependency injection and reap its benefits. This example applies DI to the `ProductDataService`, making the application more testable, maintainable, and flexible.
