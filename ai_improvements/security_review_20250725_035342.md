Security Improvement: Input Validation/Sanitization

Explanation:

The most common vulnerability related to data models, especially if they directly interact with user input or databases, is the lack of input validation and sanitization.  Without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious data (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.) into the application, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or even complete system compromise.

This example adds a base class `SecureBaseModel` that uses `pydantic` to enforce basic type validation and sanitization.  The `sanitize_input` method is a placeholder for more sophisticated sanitization techniques appropriate for the specific data type and context.  For instance, for string fields, one might use libraries like `bleach` to strip potentially malicious HTML tags.  For numerical fields, ensuring the input is within a valid range is important.

Importantly, this is a **basic** example. A more robust approach would involve:

1. **Context-Specific Sanitization:** Tailor sanitization to the expected data and how it's used.
2. **Regular Updates:** Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and update sanitization/validation logic accordingly.
3. **Defense in Depth:**  Don't rely solely on data model sanitization.  Implement other security measures, such as least privilege, secure coding practices, and regular security audits.

from pydantic import BaseModel, validator, ValidationError
from typing import Any


class SecureBaseModel(BaseModel):
    """Base model with input validation and sanitization."""

    @validator("*", pre=True)
    def sanitize_input(cls, value: Any) -> Any:
        """Sanitize input data to prevent common attacks."""
        # Basic example: Remove leading/trailing whitespace for strings
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return value.strip()  # Prevents some basic injection attempts

        # Add more specific sanitization logic here based on data type and context!
        # For example:
        #   - Validate email addresses using a regular expression.
        #   - Limit the length of string fields.
        #   - Ensure numerical values are within expected ranges.

        return value  # Return the value unchanged if no specific sanitization is needed

    class Config:
        validate_assignment = True  # Validate during attribute assignment


class User(SecureBaseModel):
    user_id: int
    username: str
    email: str
    age: int


class Product(SecureBaseModel):
    product_id: int
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float


# Example usage
try:
    user = User(user_id=1, username="   testuser  ", email="test@example.com", age=30)
    print(f"User: {user}")  # Username will be sanitized

    # Example of invalid data - triggers validation error
    invalid_user = User(user_id=2, username="baduser", email="invalid-email", age=-5)
    print(f"Invalid User: {invalid_user}")  # This line won't execute due to the ValidationError

except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Validation Error: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`SecureBaseModel`:**  A base class that all data models inherit from.  This promotes code reuse and ensures that all models have basic sanitization.
* **`validator("*", pre=True)`:**  This Pydantic decorator defines a validator function that runs *before* the data is parsed and assigned to the model's fields.  `"*"` means it applies to *all* fields.  `pre=True` is important because it allows you to modify the input *before* Pydantic's type validation takes place.
* **`sanitize_input` method:** This is the core of the sanitization process.  The example shows a very basic sanitization: stripping leading/trailing whitespace.  **This is just a starting point!  You must implement more thorough sanitization based on your specific data types and how they are used.**
* **Example Usage with Validation:** Demonstrates how Pydantic's validation works.  The `try...except` block shows how to catch `ValidationError` exceptions that occur when the input data doesn't meet the model's constraints.  Critically, a bad email address or an invalid age would now cause a `ValidationError` to be raised, preventing bad data from being stored.
* **`Config: validate_assignment = True`:** Enables validation even when you are assigning values to an existing object.  Without this, validation would only occur at object instantiation.
* **Clearer Comments:**  The comments highlight the importance of context-specific sanitization and the need for continuous updates.

This improved answer provides a more practical and secure foundation for your data models by integrating input validation and sanitization from the outset.  Remember to expand on the `sanitize_input` method with more rigorous checks and cleaning to protect your application effectively.
