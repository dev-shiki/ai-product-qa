**Justification:**

The primary performance bottleneck in many Streamlit applications arises from repeated calls to external APIs.  Caching API responses can significantly reduce latency and server load, especially when the same data is requested multiple times during a user session or across different user interactions.

The `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module provides a simple and effective way to implement memoization (caching the results of function calls) for the `fetch_data_from_api` function.

Here's how it works:

1. **`@lru_cache(maxsize=32)`:**  This decorator wraps the `fetch_data_from_api` function. `maxsize=32` sets a limit of 32 cached results.  LRU (Least Recently Used) means that if the cache exceeds its maximum size, the least recently accessed item is evicted to make space for new results.  The appropriate `maxsize` needs to be chosen based on the number of potentially distinct API calls and memory considerations.

2. **How it improves performance:** When `fetch_data_from_api` is called with specific `endpoint` and `params` arguments, `lru_cache` first checks if the result for those arguments is already in the cache.  If it is, the cached result is returned immediately, avoiding the API call entirely.  If the result is not in the cache, the function is executed, the result is stored in the cache, and then returned.  Subsequent calls with the same arguments will retrieve the cached result.

3. **Error Handling**: Includes `try...except` block and `response.raise_for_status()` for better error handling.  This will catch common network errors and HTTP errors, presenting an informative error message in the Streamlit app.

This optimization is particularly effective in Streamlit apps where data retrieval is a frequent operation and where some data remains relatively static during a session (e.g., product catalogs, category lists, etc.).
