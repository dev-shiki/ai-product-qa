## Quick Insights

Given the project structure and size, here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Enforce consistent code style with a linter and formatter:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to automatically check for style inconsistencies and format code. This improves readability and collaboration, especially with multiple Python files. Integrate them into a pre-commit hook or CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Implement dependency management:** Use a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file (with Poetry or pipenv) to explicitly declare project dependencies. This ensures reproducible builds and simplifies project setup for new developers or different environments.
