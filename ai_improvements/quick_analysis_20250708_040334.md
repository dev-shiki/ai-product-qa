## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Consistent Style & Linting:** With 21 Python files, enforcing a consistent style is crucial. Implement a linter (like Flake8) and a formatter (like Black) in your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures code readability and helps catch potential errors early.

2. **Modular Testing:**  Having 8 test files is good. Consider organizing tests mirroring the `app` directory structure.  For example, a `tests/api/test_products.py` file to test `app/api/products.py`.  This enhances test discoverability and maintainability.
