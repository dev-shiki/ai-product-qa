## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Implement a Linter & Formatter:**  Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all 21 files. This improves readability, reduces stylistic debates, and helps catch potential errors early. Run these tools as part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check code quality before merging.

2. **Consider Type Hinting:** Gradually introduce type hints (using the `typing` module) to your code, especially in critical modules like `app/models/product.py`. Type hints improve code clarity, enable static analysis, and help prevent type-related errors during development. Start small and incrementally add them where it provides the most benefit.
