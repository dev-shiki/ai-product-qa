## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    """Tests that valid settings are loaded correctly."""
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings()  # Rely on environment variable
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    """Tests that invalid settings raise a ValueError."""
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings() # Rely on environment variable

```

**Refactoring Improvement:**

Remove redundant argument passing to `config.Settings()` and rely on the environment variable.

**Explanation:**

The original code passed the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` directly to the `Settings` constructor, even though the environment variable was already set using `monkeypatch`.  This is redundant and obscures the intended behavior, which is to test that the `Settings` class correctly reads the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from the environment.

The refactored code removes the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` argument from the `config.Settings()` calls.  Now, `config.Settings()` will solely rely on the environment variables that were previously set by `monkeypatch`. This makes the tests more focused on verifying that the `Settings` class loads values from the environment as expected, and reduces redundancy.  The docstrings were also added to improve readability.  This assumes that `config.Settings` is designed to read values from the environment if they are not explicitly passed as constructor arguments. If it does not work that way, this refactoring is not suitable.  The tests should then verify that passing an empty string or no value to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` when constructing the `Settings` object reads from the environment.
