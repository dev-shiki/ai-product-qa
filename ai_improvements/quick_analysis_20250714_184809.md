## Quick Insights

1.  **Code Linting & Formatting:** Implement a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` for code style consistency and to catch potential errors across all Python files. Integrate a formatter like `black` for automatic code formatting. This ensures readability and reduces stylistic debates.

2.  **Test Coverage:** Analyze the test coverage of your 8 test files. Aim for high coverage (80%+) to ensure critical parts of the codebase are properly tested. Use tools like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage and identify areas needing more tests. Focus initially on key modules like those in `app/models`.
