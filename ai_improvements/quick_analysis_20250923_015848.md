## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Linting & Formatting:**  Implement a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black` (or `autopep8`).  This automatically enforces consistent code style and catches potential errors early, improving readability and maintainability across all 21 Python files.  This ensures everyone contributes code that aligns with a unified style.

2. **Centralized Configuration:**  Instead of potentially scattering configuration throughout the `config.py` module, consider loading configurations from environment variables or a dedicated configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON).  This makes deployment and configuration management easier, especially in different environments.
