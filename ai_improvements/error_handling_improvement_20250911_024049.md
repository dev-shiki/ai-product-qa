## Improvement

Okay, I need to know which part of the data models you want to improve error handling on.  Since you haven't provided any actual data model code, I'll create a *very basic* example and then demonstrate improved error handling on one aspect of it:  **Data Validation**.

**Original (Basic) Code**

```python
"""
Data models for the application.
"""

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, age):
        self.username = username
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User(username='{self.username}', age={self.age})"


# Example Usage (Potentially problematic)
user1 = User("Alice", 30)
user2 = User("Bob", -5)  # Uh oh, negative age!
print(user1)
print(user2)
```

**Improved Code (with Error Handling on Age Validation)**

```python
"""
Data models for the application.  Includes validation.
"""

class ValidationError(Exception):  # Custom exception for validation issues
    pass


class User:
    def __init__(self, username, age):
        self.username = username
        self.age = self.validate_age(age) # Validation upon initialization

    def validate_age(self, age):
        if not isinstance(age, int):
            raise ValidationError("Age must be an integer.")  #Specific error message
        if age < 0:
            raise ValidationError("Age cannot be negative.") #Specific error message
        if age > 150:
            raise ValidationError("Age is unrealistic.") #Specific error message
        return age


    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User(username='{self.username}', age={self.age})"



# Example Usage (with error handling)
try:
    user1 = User("Alice", 30)
    print(user1)
    user2 = User("Bob", -5)  # This will now raise an exception
    print(user2)  # This line will not be reached if the exception is raised

except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Error creating user: {e}")
```

Key Improvements and Explanations:

1. **Custom Exception Class:**  I defined a `ValidationError` exception class.  This is important for creating specific and identifiable error conditions within your data models.  It's better than using a generic `Exception` because it allows you to catch and handle validation errors separately from other types of errors.

2. **Validation Function:** I created a `validate_age` method within the `User` class.  This method performs the actual validation logic.

3. **Type Checking:** `isinstance(age, int)`: Checks that the age is an integer

4. **Range Checking:**  `age < 0` and `age > 150`:  These lines check for valid age ranges.  Adjust the upper limit as needed.

5. **`raise` Statement:**  `raise ValidationError("Age cannot be negative.")`:  When the validation fails, the `raise` statement creates a `ValidationError` exception, passing a descriptive error message. This halts the execution of the `__init__` method.

6. **Call Validation in `__init__`:**  `self.age = self.validate_age(age)`: The `validate_age` method is called from the `__init__` method to ensure that the age is validated when a `User` object is created. This helps prevent the creation of invalid objects.

7. **`try...except` Block:**  The example usage code is wrapped in a `try...except` block.  This allows you to gracefully handle the `ValidationError` if it's raised.  The `except` block catches the exception, prints an informative error message, and prevents the program from crashing.

**How to Apply This to Your Specific Code:**

1. **Identify Validation Points:**  Think about the data that's being stored in your data models and what rules it needs to follow.  For example:
   - Strings might need to be a certain length or match a specific pattern (e.g., email address).
   - Numbers might need to be within a certain range.
   - Dates might need to be in the past or future.
   - Relationships between data fields might need to be enforced (e.g., a start date must be before an end date).

2. **Create Validation Functions:** Write functions to validate each piece of data. These functions should:
   - Take the data as input.
   - Check if the data meets the required conditions.
   - If the data is invalid, raise a `ValidationError` with a descriptive error message.
   - If the data is valid, return the data (or a modified/cleaned version of the data if needed).

3. **Call Validation Functions in `__init__` (or elsewhere):**  Call the validation functions from the `__init__` method of your data models to ensure that data is validated when objects are created.  You might also want to call validation functions when data is modified.

4. **Use `try...except` Blocks:**  Wrap the code that creates or modifies data model objects in `try...except` blocks to handle `ValidationError` exceptions gracefully.

**Example: Validating an Email Address**

```python
import re

class ValidationError(Exception):
    pass

def validate_email(email):
    """Validates an email address using a regular expression."""
    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    if not re.match(pattern, email):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid email address format.")
    return email

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email):
        self.username = username
        self.email = self.validate_email(email)  #Call the validation function in constructor

    def validate_email(self, email):
        return validate_email(email)  #Use the separate function

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User(username='{self.username}', email='{self.email}')"

# Example usage
try:
    user = User("John Doe", "invalid-email")
    print(user)
except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Error creating user: {e}")
```

Remember to adapt the validation rules and error messages to your specific application's needs.  By incorporating validation and error handling into your data models, you can create more robust and reliable applications.  Also, consider adding logging as well to help debug your data models.
