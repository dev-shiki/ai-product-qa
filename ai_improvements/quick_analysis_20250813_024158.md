## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a Linter & Formatter:** Enforce consistent code style across all files. Tools like `flake8` and `black` can automatically check and format your code, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage, especially in core modules like `queries.py` and `products.py`. More comprehensive tests provide confidence in your code's correctness and reduce the risk of regressions during future changes. Consider using `pytest` with a coverage plugin.
