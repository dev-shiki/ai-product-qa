**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a Linter & Formatter:** Introduce a linter (like Pylint or Flake8) and a formatter (like Black or autopep8).  This ensures consistent code style across all 21 files, improving readability and maintainability. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality checks.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:**  With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, overall test coverage might be low. Analyze code coverage reports (using `pytest-cov`, for example) to identify untested areas and prioritize writing more unit/integration tests, especially for crucial modules like `app/models/product.py`.
