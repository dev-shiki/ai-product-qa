## Improvement

```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword}")
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword}")
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword '{keyword}': {str(e)}")  # Changed from error to exception
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
            else:
                return self.get_all_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting products (limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}): {str(e)}") # Changed from error to exception and included variables.
            return self.local_service.get_products(limit)
    
    async def get_categories(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get available categories"""
        try:
            return self.local_service.get_categories()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting categories: {str(e)}")  # Changed from error to exception
            return []
... (truncated for analysis)
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception` instead of `logger.error`:** This is the most important change. `logger.exception` automatically includes the traceback information in the log message.  This makes debugging *significantly* easier.  Without the traceback, you only know *that* an error occurred, but not *where* or *why*. The traceback points to the exact line of code that raised the exception and the chain of calls that led to it.
* **Included relevant variables in the error log:**  In `get_products`, the original code only logged "Error getting products". This is not very helpful.  The improved code includes the `limit`, `category`, and `search` parameters in the log message: `f"Error getting products (limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}): {str(e)}"`.  This provides context to the error, making it much easier to understand what went wrong.  This also applies to the `search_products` method, including the `keyword` that triggered the error.
* **No change to functionality:** The fundamental logic of the functions remains the same. The focus is solely on providing better, more informative error logging.

Why these changes are important:

When debugging production systems, you rely heavily on logs to understand what's happening.  Poorly written logs make it much harder to diagnose and fix problems, leading to increased downtime and developer frustration. By using `logger.exception` and including relevant context in the log messages, you make it significantly easier to identify and resolve errors quickly.
