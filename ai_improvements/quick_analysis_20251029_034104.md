## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:** Consolidate application settings (API keys, database credentials, etc.) into a single configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or using `.env` files and a library like `python-dotenv`). This promotes maintainability and simplifies deployment by decoupling code from environment-specific settings.

2. **Consistent Logging:** Implement a standardized logging system using Python's `logging` module across all files. This will dramatically improve debugging and monitoring capabilities. Define a common logging configuration for format, level, and destinations (console, file).
