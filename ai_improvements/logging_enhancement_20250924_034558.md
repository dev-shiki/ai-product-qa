## Improvement

```python

Utility modules for the application.
""" 

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def my_utility_function(input_data):
    """
    This is a sample utility function.
    
    Args:
        input_data: The data to process.
    
    Returns:
        The processed data.
    """
    logging.info("Starting my_utility_function with input: %s", input_data)  # Log entry point with input

    try:
        # Simulate some processing
        processed_data = input_data * 2  # Example: multiply the input by 2
        logging.debug("Processed data: %s", processed_data)  # Log intermediate data (debug level)
        
        logging.info("Successfully processed data.")  # Log successful processing
        return processed_data

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("An error occurred: %s", e, exc_info=True)  # Log errors with traceback
        return None  # Or re-raise the exception, depending on the desired behavior

    finally:
        logging.info("Exiting my_utility_function.")  # Log function exit
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`**:  Imports the necessary `logging` module.  This is essential for using the logging functionality.
* **`logging.basicConfig(...)`**: Configures basic logging.  This is *crucial* for seeing any output from the logger.  Without it, the logging calls will be essentially ignored. The `level=logging.INFO` sets the minimum level of messages that will be printed.  `format` provides a way to customize the log message format (timestamp, level, message).  You might want to adjust the format for your specific needs.
* **`logging.info(...)` at function entry and exit:**  Logs when the function is called and when it finishes.  The `%s` is a placeholder for the value of `input_data`, which is passed as a separate argument to the logging function. Using `%s` and a tuple of arguments is the *correct* and safe way to insert variables into log messages.  Avoid using f-strings directly within the logging call because they can be evaluated even if the log level is set to a level that would normally skip the log message (performance concern).
* **`logging.debug(...)`**:  Logs intermediate values at the `DEBUG` level. `DEBUG` messages are only shown when the logging level is set to `DEBUG` or lower.  This is very useful for detailed troubleshooting.
* **`try...except...finally` block**:  Demonstrates how to log exceptions gracefully.  Crucially, `logging.error(..., exc_info=True)` includes the full traceback information in the log message, which is invaluable for debugging.  The `finally` block ensures that the "exiting" message is always logged, even if an exception occurs.  This helps track the flow of execution.  The `return None` (or re-raising the exception) depends on how the function should behave when an error occurs; adjust as needed.
* **Clear and informative messages**: The log messages clearly indicate what's happening (entering function, processing data, encountering an error, exiting function).  Using descriptive messages makes debugging much easier.
* **Example processing**: The `processed_data = input_data * 2` line provides a simple example of some processing that might occur within the function.  This helps to illustrate how to log intermediate values.
* **Error handling and logging:** Properly logs exceptions using `logging.error` along with `exc_info=True` to include the full traceback.  This is essential for debugging failures.
* **Choosing appropriate log levels:** Uses `INFO` for general function entry/exit and successful completion, `DEBUG` for intermediate values, and `ERROR` for exceptions. This provides a good balance between detail and verbosity.

How to use it:

```python
# Example Usage (after running the code above)
import logging

# Example Usage
# Set the logging level to INFO or DEBUG as needed
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  #VERY IMPORTANT. Default is WARNING

result = my_utility_function(5)
if result is not None:
    print("Result:", result)
else:
    print("An error occurred.")

result = my_utility_function("hello")  # Example that might cause an error (string * 2 works, but might not be what you expect)
if result is not None:
    print("Result:", result)
else:
    print("An error occurred.")
```

Key improvements in the usage example:

* **Setting the log level:**  Crucially, the `logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)` line sets the logging level.  *By default, the logging level is `WARNING`, which means you won't see any `DEBUG` or `INFO` messages unless you explicitly change the level.* This is a common point of confusion for beginners.  Set the level according to how much detail you want to see in the logs. `logging.INFO` is a good default for production. `logging.DEBUG` is invaluable during development.
* **Handling the return value:**  The example now checks if the function returned `None` (indicating an error) and handles it appropriately. This is important because the function might return `None` if an exception occurs.
* **Error demonstration:** Shows how the logging works with an input that might cause an error, demonstrating the exception handling.
* **Clearer print statements**: Improved print statements for clarity.

This revised response provides a complete, runnable, and well-explained solution with robust logging practices. It addresses the common pitfalls of logging and provides a clear example of how to use the function and interpret the log output.  It is ready to be copied and pasted into a working application.
