**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the file structure, a clear improvement would be to **enforce consistent code style using a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a formatter (like Black)**. This improves readability and maintainability across all files. Secondly, **consider implementing a more robust testing strategy**. 8 test files for 21 code files *might* indicate inadequate test coverage. Prioritize unit tests focusing on individual functions in modules like `queries.py` and `products.py` to ensure each unit works correctly.
