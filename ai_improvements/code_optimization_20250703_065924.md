# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Use `json.loads` directly instead of `json.dumps` then `json.loads` if you're already dealing with Python data.**

**Explanation:**

If `mock_json_data` is already constructed as a Python dictionary or list within the fixture (as it appears to be), avoid unnecessarily converting it to a JSON string and then back to a Python object. Directly work with the Python data structure.  This eliminates one unneeded conversion.
