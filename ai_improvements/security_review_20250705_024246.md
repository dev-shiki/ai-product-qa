**Security Improvement:**

The most important improvement is to **store the `API_BASE_URL` in an environment variable instead of hardcoding it directly in the script**.

**Explanation:**

*   **Hardcoding Risks:** Hardcoding sensitive information like API endpoints directly into your code is a security risk. If the code is ever committed to a public repository (e.g., GitHub), the endpoint becomes exposed.  This can lead to unauthorized access to your backend API.

*   **Environment Variables:** Environment variables are key-value pairs that are set outside of the application's code.  They are typically configured in the operating system or deployment environment.  This makes it easier to manage configuration settings, including sensitive information, without modifying the code itself.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Security:** Sensitive information is not stored directly in the code, reducing the risk of exposure.
    *   **Flexibility:**  You can easily change the API endpoint without modifying the code.  This is particularly useful when deploying to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
    *   **Configuration Management:**  Environment variables provide a centralized way to manage application configuration.

*   **Implementation:**

    1.  **`os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`**:  This line retrieves the value of the environment variable named `API_BASE_URL`.
        *   `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL")`:  This attempts to get the value of the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable.  If the variable is not set, it returns `None`.
        *   `"http://localhost:8000"`:  This is a default value.  If the environment variable `API_BASE_URL` is not found, the code will use "http://localhost:8000" as the base URL.  This is useful for local development when the environment variable might not be set.

**How to set environment variables:**

The way you set environment variables depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  Here are a few common ways:

*   **Local Development (Command Line):**

    ```bash
    export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"  # Linux/macOS
    set API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com   # Windows
    ```

*   **`.env` file (using a library like `python-dotenv`):**

    1.  Install: `pip install python-dotenv`
    2.  Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your script:

        ```
        API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com
        ```

    3.  In your Python script:

        ```python
        from dotenv import load_dotenv
        import os

        load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file

        API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL")
        ```

*   **Deployment Environments (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Docker):**  Most deployment platforms provide a way to set environment variables through their web interface or command-line tools. Consult the documentation for your specific platform.

This change, while seemingly small, greatly improves the security and manageability of your application. It is a crucial best practice.
