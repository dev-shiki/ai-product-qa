# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:29:51  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the presence of tests and the number of Python files, two quick improvement suggestions are:

1.  **Implement a consistent code style:** Use a linter (like `flake8`) and formatter (like `black`) across the project to enforce a uniform coding style. This improves readability and reduces potential style-related errors.

2.  **Introduce Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to automatically run tests and linting on every push/pull request. This ensures that code changes don't break existing functionality and adhere to the established code style, catching issues early.
