## Improvement

**Improvement:**

Create a single `ProductSpecifications` instance and reuse it across tests where appropriate.

**Explanation:**

The original code creates separate `ProductSpecifications` instances in `test_product_specifications` and `test_product`.  If the specifications required are the same or a subset in different tests, creating a single instance and reusing it reduces object creation overhead and improves performance (even if marginally).  For example:

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

# Create a specifications instance to be reused
base_spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")

def test_product_specifications():
    spec = base_spec  # Reuse the base_spec
    assert spec.rating == 4.5
    assert spec.sold == 100
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    assert spec.color == "Hitam"

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5) # Keep this as is since only the rating is being tested.
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
```

This is a minor optimization, but in test suites with many tests and complex object instantiation, reducing object creation can contribute to faster test execution.  This is most effective when the same object data is used across multiple tests.  In `test_product` the specifications required is different so we can't resuse `base_spec` here.
