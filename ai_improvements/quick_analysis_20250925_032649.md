**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick Python project improvement suggestions:

1.  **Implement a robust linting and code formatting setup.** With 21 files, maintaining consistent style and catching errors early is crucial.  Integrate tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, and `black` into your CI/CD pipeline. Standardized code reduces cognitive load and makes contributions easier.

2.  **Analyze test coverage.**  Having 8 test files is great, but ensure they cover critical code paths.  Use `coverage.py` to identify uncovered areas.  Aim for high coverage, especially in `queries.py` and `products.py` where business logic likely resides, to prevent regressions and improve code reliability.
