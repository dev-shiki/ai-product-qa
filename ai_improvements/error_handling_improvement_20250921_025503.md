## Improvement

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

def test_product_specifications():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5
    assert spec.sold == 100
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    assert spec.color == "Hitam"

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    try:
        assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
    except KeyError as e:
        raise AssertionError(f"The 'rating' key is missing from specifications: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        raise AssertionError(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Key improvements in error handling for `test_product_response`:

*   **`try...except` block:** Encloses the potentially problematic line (`assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5`) within a `try...except` block.  This allows us to catch exceptions that might occur when accessing the `specifications` dictionary.
*   **Specific `KeyError` handling:**  Catches the `KeyError` specifically. This exception is raised when you try to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.  The `except KeyError as e:` part captures the exception object itself, which contains details about the error (e.g., the missing key).
*   **Informative error message:**  If a `KeyError` is caught, a more informative `AssertionError` is raised.  The message includes the original `KeyError` message, making it much easier to diagnose the problem (e.g., "The 'rating' key is missing from specifications").
*   **Generic `Exception` handling:** Includes a general `except Exception as e:` block after the specific `KeyError` handling. This will catch any other unexpected errors that might occur during the assertion. This prevents the test from crashing due to an unhandled exception and provides a more helpful error message.
*   **Re-raising as `AssertionError`:**  In both `except` blocks, the caught exception (either `KeyError` or a generic `Exception`) is re-raised as an `AssertionError`.  This is important because the testing framework expects assertions to fail by raising `AssertionError`.  Simply printing an error message and continuing would cause the test to incorrectly pass.

This revised `test_product_response` function is more robust because it anticipates and handles potential errors during dictionary access, providing more informative error messages that facilitate debugging and prevent the test from passing incorrectly when an error occurs.  It addresses the core issue of safely and informatively asserting a value within a dictionary.
