```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

def test_product_specifications():
    try:
        spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
        assert spec.rating == 4.5
        assert spec.sold == 100
        assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
        assert spec.color == "Hitam"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion failed in test_product_specifications: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to fail the test
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred in test_product_specifications: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to fail the test

        )
        assert product.id == "1"
        assert product.specifications.rating == 5
        assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion failed in test_product: {e}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred in test_product: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to fail the test

    try:
        resp = ProductResponse(
            id="1",

            price=1000000,
            description="Deskripsi produk",
            specifications={"rating": 5},
            images=["img1.jpg"],
            url="http://produk.com/1"
        )
        assert resp.id == "1"
        assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion failed in test_product_response: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to fail the test
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"KeyError in test_product_response: {e}.  Possibly missing key in specifications.")
        raise #Re-raise to fail the test
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred in test_product_response: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise to fail the test
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` blocks around each test function:**  This is the core of the error handling.  The code that might raise exceptions (like `AssertionError`, `KeyError` or other unexpected errors) is placed inside the `try` block.

* **Specific Exception Handling:** I added specific `except` blocks:
    * `AssertionError`:  Catches failures of the `assert` statements. This is crucial because assertion errors indicate that the test failed.
    * `KeyError`: Specifically catches `KeyError` exceptions that might occur when accessing dictionaries, specifically `resp.specifications["rating"]`.  This helps diagnose problems with the structure of the `specifications` data.
    * `Exception`: This is a general catch-all for any other unexpected errors that might occur during the test.  It's important to include this to prevent tests from silently passing when they shouldn't.

* **Informative Error Messages:**  Inside each `except` block, a `print()` statement logs a helpful error message indicating which test failed and what the error was. This is invaluable for debugging. The message includes the exception itself (`e`) so you can see the details.

* **Re-raising Exceptions:** After logging the error message, `raise` is used to re-raise the exception.  This is *essential*!  If you catch an exception and don't re-raise it, the test will continue as if nothing went wrong, leading to false positives.  Re-raising the exception ensures that the test framework knows the test failed.

* **Why not just one `try...except` block at the beginning?:** While technically possible, wrapping the *entire* test in a single `try...except` makes it harder to pinpoint the exact line of code that caused the error. The more specific `try...except` blocks allow you to isolate the problem more quickly.

* **`KeyError` handling in `test_product_response`:** The code now explicitly handles potential `KeyError` exceptions when accessing the `specifications` dictionary. This is crucial because if the `"rating"` key is missing, the test would fail.  Providing a more informative message specifically for this situation makes debugging much easier.

This revised code provides much better error handling, making your tests more robust and easier to debug.  When a test fails, you'll get a clear error message pinpointing the source of the problem.
