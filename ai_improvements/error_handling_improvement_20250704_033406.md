## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.queries.product_service")
async def test_get_brands(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_brands.return_value = ["Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"]
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed with status {e.response.status_code}: {e.response.text}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert "brands" in data
    assert set(data["brands"]) >= {"Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"}

```

Key improvements in this solution:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`**: This is the most crucial addition.  It checks the HTTP status code of the response and raises an `HTTPStatusError` if the code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx).  Without this, the test would pass even if the API endpoint returned a 500 Internal Server Error, which is obviously not desired.
* **`try...except` block**: This wraps the `ac.get()` call and the `resp.raise_for_status()` call within a `try...except` block. This allows catching potential exceptions during the request process, such as network issues or server errors.  Critically, it now catches *two* kinds of exceptions: `HTTPStatusError` and a general `Exception`.  This ensures *all* exceptions during the `get` request are handled.
* **`pytest.fail()`**: Instead of simply letting the test crash, the `except` blocks now use `pytest.fail()` to explicitly mark the test as failed, providing a clear error message.  This message includes the status code and response text from the server (in case of an HTTP error) and details about unexpected errors.  This makes debugging much easier.
* **Clearer Error Messages**: The error messages now explicitly state why the test failed. The `HTTPStatusError` message includes the status code and response body for better diagnostics.
* **Handles Network Errors**: The `Exception` catch handles generic exceptions, which is especially important for the `AsyncClient`, as it can raise exceptions if it cannot connect.

This improved version is much more robust and will provide more informative feedback when errors occur during testing.  It correctly detects and reports API errors, making the tests more reliable and helpful for developers. It isolates the error handling improvements to the specific test function as requested in the prompt. This prevents any possible side effects from changes in the other test functions.
