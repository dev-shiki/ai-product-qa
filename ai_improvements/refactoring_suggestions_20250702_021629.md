```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, Optional, List

class ProductSpecifications(BaseModel):
    rating: Optional[float] = 0.0
    sold: Optional[int] = 0
    stock: Optional[int] = 0
    condition: Optional[str] = "Baru"
    shop_location: Optional[str] = "Indonesia"
    shop_name: Optional[str] = "Online Store"
    storage: Optional[str] = None
    color: Optional[str] = None
    warranty: Optional[str] = None

class Product(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(..., description="Unique product identifier")
    name: str = Field(..., description="Product name")
    category: str = Field(..., description="Product category")
    brand: str = Field(..., description="Product brand")
    price: int = Field(..., description="Product price in IDR")
    currency: str = Field(default="IDR", description="Currency code")
    description: str = Field(..., description="Product description")
    specifications: ProductSpecifications = Field(..., description="Product specifications")
    images: Optional[List[str]] = Field(default=[], description="Product images")
    url: Optional[str] = Field(default="", description="Product URL")

class ProductResponse(Product):  # Refactor: Inherit from Product
    specifications: Dict  # Override type hint


class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    products: List[dict]
    question: str
    note: Optional[str] = None
```

**Explanation of Refactoring Improvement:**

The `ProductResponse` class was largely a duplicate of the `Product` class, repeating many of the same fields. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The key difference was the type hint for `specifications` (Dict vs ProductSpecifications).

The refactored code addresses this by making `ProductResponse` inherit from `Product`.  This automatically includes all the fields of `Product` in `ProductResponse`. Then, we override the `specifications` field in `ProductResponse` to use the desired `Dict` type hint.  This approach ensures that the code is more maintainable and easier to understand. We only define the differences between the two classes, rather than duplicating the shared attributes.

This inheritance promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. It also avoids potential inconsistencies if the fields of `Product` are changed in the future, as those changes will automatically be reflected in `ProductResponse`.
