## Quick Insights

Given the size and structure, consider these improvements:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all 21 files. This boosts readability and reduces potential errors, especially across a larger codebase.

2.  **Improve test discoverability:** If your test files aren't automatically detected, explicitly configure your test runner (e.g., `pytest` with a `pytest.ini` file) to ensure all 8 tests are run. This ensures comprehensive coverage and reduces the risk of undetected bugs.
