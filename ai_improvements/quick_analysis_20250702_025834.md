## Quick Insights

Given the project structure, focusing on modularity and testing:

1.  **Enforce stricter modularity and API contracts:**  Use type hints (mypy) and dataclasses to clearly define input/output structures for functions, especially within `app/api/products.py`.  This will improve code clarity and prevent runtime errors.

2.  **Increase test coverage in `app/api`:**  Focus testing on the `products.py` module. Consider implementing integration tests to ensure proper interaction with the main application flow defined in `main.py`. This validates that API endpoints behave as expected within the context of the broader application.
