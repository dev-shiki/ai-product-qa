## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    logger.info("Fetching settings...")
    settings = Settings()
    logger.debug(f"Settings loaded: {settings}")
    return settings

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of changes:**

1.  **`logger.info("Fetching settings...")`**:  Logs an informational message at the beginning of the function to indicate that the settings retrieval process has started.  This helps track when settings are being accessed.

2.  **`settings = Settings()`**: Creates an instance of the `Settings` class.

3.  **`logger.debug(f"Settings loaded: {settings}")`**:  Logs the entire `settings` object at the DEBUG level.  This provides a detailed view of all the settings values that were loaded, which is invaluable for debugging configuration issues. Using an f-string makes it easier to include the object's representation in the log message.

These log messages allow you to easily track when the settings are being loaded, what the values are, and troubleshoot configuration problems.  The debug level allows for detailed output that can be turned on and off as needed in a production environment without affecting other log levels.
