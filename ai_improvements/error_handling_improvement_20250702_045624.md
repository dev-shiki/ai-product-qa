## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {

        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")  # Fail the test with a descriptive message
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}") # Fail the test with unexpected error

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products_with_category(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {

... (truncated for analysis)
```

Key improvements in error handling:

1. **`resp.raise_for_status()`:**  This is the core addition.  It checks the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception.  This is *critical* for detecting API errors that would otherwise be missed.

2. **`try...except` block:**  The code now wraps the `ac.get()` call and the `resp.raise_for_status()` line in a `try...except` block. This allows us to catch potential errors during the HTTP request and response handling.

3. **Specific `HTTPStatusError` handling:** The `except HTTPStatusError as e:` block specifically catches HTTP error responses.  It then calls `pytest.fail()` to immediately fail the test and provides a descriptive error message that includes the original HTTP error. This is much more informative than a generic assertion failure.

4. **Generic `Exception` handling:**  The `except Exception as e:` block catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur during the process (e.g., network errors, JSON parsing errors). It also fails the test with an informative error message.

5. **`pytest.fail()`:**  Instead of relying on potentially obscure assertion failures later in the test, `pytest.fail()` immediately stops the test and clearly indicates the reason for the failure. This makes debugging much easier.

Why these changes are important:

* **Robustness:**  The original code would only check if the status code was 200.  If the server returned a 500 error (server-side error) or a 400 error (bad request), the test would still proceed, potentially leading to misleading results or difficult-to-debug assertion failures.
* **Clarity:**  The `pytest.fail()` messages provide explicit reasons for test failures, making it immediately clear what went wrong.
* **Completeness:** The `try...except` block handles *all* potential exceptions during the request process, not just specific ones, ensuring that any error is caught and reported.

This revised version provides significantly more robust and informative error handling, leading to more reliable and maintainable tests.  This improvement makes the test much more valuable as it will accurately flag unexpected issues with the API being tested.
