# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:38:51  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce code style:** Use a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a formatter (like Black or Autopep8) to maintain consistent code style across all 21 Python files. Consistent style enhances readability and reduces cognitive load when navigating different modules.  Consider integrating this into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve testing:**  Aim for higher test coverage than just the 8 test files might imply. Ensure your tests cover different scenarios, edge cases, and error handling within key files like `queries.py` and `products.py`. Aim for >80% code coverage.
