## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Secure CORS configuration:  Limit origins to a trusted list.
origins = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "").split(",")
origins = [origin.strip() for origin in origins if origin.strip()]  # Clean the origins list

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,  # Use the restricted origin list
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The original code used `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`. This is a significant security risk because it allows *any* website to make requests to your API.  This opens the door to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and other vulnerabilities.

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_origins=origins`, where `origins` is a list of allowed origins read from an environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

**Here's why this is better and how it works:**

1. **Controlled Access:** Instead of allowing all origins, you now explicitly define which origins are permitted to access your API.

2. **Environment Variable Configuration:** The allowed origins are stored in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. This makes the configuration more flexible and secure.  You can change the allowed origins without modifying the code itself.  Environment variables are often used in production deployments for sensitive configurations.

3. **Robust Handling of the Environment Variable:** The code splits the environment variable into a list of origins using `.split(",")`.  It also cleans up each origin by using `strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace and includes only valid origins, preventing errors when the env variable is improperly set.

**How to use the improved code:**

1. **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:**  Before running the application, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of allowed origins. For example:

   ```bash
   export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:3000` and `https://www.example.com` with the actual origins you want to allow.

2. **Run the application:**  Run your FastAPI application as usual.

Now, only requests from the specified origins will be allowed by the CORS middleware.  Requests from other origins will be blocked by the browser.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Production Deployment:**  In a production environment, *never* use `allow_origins=["*"]`.  Carefully consider and list only the specific origins that need to access your API.
* **Security Best Practices:**  This is just one security improvement.  You should also implement other security measures, such as authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt communication between clients and your API.  This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep your dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your API's security to identify and fix potential weaknesses.
