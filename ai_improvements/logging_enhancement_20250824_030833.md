## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    logging.info("Starting test_get_products")
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logging.debug("Sending GET request to /api/products/")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
        logging.debug(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logging.debug(f"Response data: {data}")
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)
    logging.info("test_get_products finished successfully")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products_with_category(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
... (truncated for analysis)

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`**: Imports the logging module.  Crucially, this was missing.
* **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`**:  Initializes the logging system.  This is essential.  Without this, no log messages will appear.  `level=logging.DEBUG` sets the logging level to show all debug, info, warning, error, and critical messages.   This should be adjusted based on the desired verbosity and environment.  In a production setting, you'd likely use a different, more sophisticated configuration (e.g., writing to a file, using a rotating log handler, etc.).  But for a simple test suite, this is sufficient.
* **Logging statements at key points:**
    * `logging.info("Starting test_get_products")`:  Indicates the start of the test function. `info` level is used as it is informational.
    * `logging.debug("Sending GET request to /api/products/")`:  Logs the HTTP request being sent.  `debug` level is used because it is detailed.
    * `logging.debug(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")`: Logs the HTTP response code.
    * `logging.debug(f"Response data: {data}")`: Logs the JSON response.  Crucially important for debugging what's being returned.
    * `logging.info("test_get_products finished successfully")`: Indicates the end of the test function.
* **f-strings for logging:**  Uses f-strings to easily embed variable values within the log messages.  This makes the log output much more informative.
* **Placement of logging statements:** Logs are placed before and after key actions (request, response, processing), providing context.
* **Correct Logging Level Selection:**  Appropriately uses `logging.info` for general information and `logging.debug` for more detailed debugging information.

This revised answer provides a complete, working solution with comprehensive logging that will significantly aid in debugging and understanding the test's execution.  It also highlights best practices for logging in Python.
