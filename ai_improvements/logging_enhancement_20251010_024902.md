# Logging Enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you'd like me to add logging statements to. I need the function definition (including its name, parameters, and existing code) to be able to add meaningful logging.

For example, if your function was:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y
```

Then I could provide you with a version that includes logging like this:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging (customize as needed)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers with logging."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")
  return result
```

**Explanation of added logging:**

*   **`import logging`**: Imports the logging module.
*   **`logging.basicConfig(...)`**:  This is crucial.  It configures the basic logging system.  Without this, your logging calls might not do anything or might only log to a default location.  You'll want to customize this based on how you want to handle logs (e.g., writing to a file, setting the log level, etc.).  I've set a basic configuration that logs to the console with INFO level messages and a timestamp.
*   **`logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")`**: Logs an informational message *before* the calculation, showing the input values.  `f-strings` (formatted string literals) are used to easily embed the variable values into the log message.
*   **`result = x + y`**: The original calculation.
*   **`logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")`**: Logs an informational message *after* the calculation, showing the result.

**Types of Logging Levels:**

*   **`logging.DEBUG`**:  Detailed information, typically only of interest to developers.
*   **`logging.INFO`**:  Confirmation that things are working as expected.
*   **`logging.WARNING`**:  An indication that something unexpected happened, or is indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
*   **`logging.ERROR`**:  Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
*   **`logging.CRITICAL`**:  A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

I can tailor the logging statements to the specific purpose and logic of your function. Just provide the function definition!
