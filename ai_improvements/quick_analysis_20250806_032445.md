# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:24:45  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Type Hints & Linting:**  Add type hints throughout the project for improved readability and maintainability.  Integrate a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` to enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early on. This would benefit all 21 Python files.

2.  **Test Coverage Analysis:**  Implement a test coverage tool (e.g., `pytest-cov`) to determine which parts of your code aren't being tested by your existing 8 test files.  Aim for higher coverage to ensure robustness and catch regressions.  This helps identify gaps in your testing strategy.
