# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Add `__slots__` to classes within the modules.

**Explanation:** If the service modules define classes that are heavily instantiated (i.e., you're creating a lot of objects of those classes), using `__slots__` can significantly reduce memory consumption and potentially improve performance.  `__slots__` prevents the creation of `__dict__` for each instance, which stores attribute values.  Instead, it pre-allocates space for specific attributes.  This saves memory because Python doesn't have to dynamically create and manage a dictionary for each object's attributes.  It can also speed up attribute access in some cases.  Just define `__slots__` as a tuple of strings representing the attribute names in the class definition.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```python
"""
Service modules for the application.
"""

class MyServiceClass:
    __slots__ = ('attribute1', 'attribute2', 'attribute3')

    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, attribute3):
        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2
        self.attribute3 = attribute3
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   `__slots__` affects inheritance and should be used with caution, especially in complex class hierarchies.
*   You can't dynamically add new attributes to instances of a class with `__slots__` defined unless `__dict__` is also explicitly defined in `__slots__`.
*   This optimization is most beneficial when you have many instances of the class.
*   This is a micro-optimization and may not be noticeable if you're not creating a large number of instances.
