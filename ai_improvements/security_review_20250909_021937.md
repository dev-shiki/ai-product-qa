## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    health_data = response.json()
    assert health_data["status"] == "healthy"
    # Example: Set version from env variable. This way we make sure no hardcoded version makes its way into the production build.
    expected_version = os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")  # Default to "1.0.0" if env var not set
    assert health_data["version"] == expected_version

```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security concern here is **hardcoding the version number** directly in the test.  While it seems innocuous, it can lead to problems:

1.  **Information Disclosure:**  Hardcoding the version makes it easier for attackers to fingerprint the application.  Knowing the exact version allows them to target known vulnerabilities specific to that version.
2.  **Deployment Issues:** A hardcoded version in the test might not reflect the actual deployed version if the update process isn't perfectly synchronized.

**Solution:**

Instead of hardcoding `"1.0.0"` in the test for `health_data["version"]`, the code now retrieves the expected version from an environment variable (`API_VERSION`).  If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to "1.0.0".

**Why is this more secure and better practice?**

*   **Configuration via Environment Variables:**  Environment variables are the standard way to configure applications, especially in containerized environments (like Docker, Kubernetes).  This decouples the application's behavior (and testing) from the code itself.  Versions can be easily updated at deploy time without modifying the source code or tests.
*   **Prevents Hardcoded Secrets/Sensitive Data:**  This practice extends to other configuration values.  Never hardcode API keys, database passwords, or other sensitive information.  Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
*   **Improved Reproducibility:** By using environment variables, the test environment can be more accurately replicated in different environments (development, staging, production).
*   **Reduced Risk of Fingerprinting:** While it doesn't completely eliminate fingerprinting, it makes it slightly harder for an attacker to definitively identify the version just by looking at the `health` endpoint response.  If the environment is not configured, it defaults to "1.0.0", so make sure you configure the version in the production environment.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security of Environment Variables:**  Make sure the environment where the application runs (e.g., the server, the container orchestration system) has mechanisms in place to protect the environment variables themselves.  Don't store sensitive environment variables in version control.  Use secrets management tools when necessary.
*   **Testing in Different Environments:**  Ensure that you test the application in different environments with different `API_VERSION` values to verify that the configuration is working correctly.

This change, while small, embodies a best practice for configuring applications securely and managing version information effectively.
