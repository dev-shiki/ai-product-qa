## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Restrict CORS origins to specific domains instead of allowing all.
origins = [
    "http://localhost",  # Example for local development
    "http://localhost:8080",  # Example for local development with a different port
    "https://your-production-domain.com", #  Replace with your actual production domain
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins, # Use the defined origins list
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The original code used `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`.  This is a **major security risk** in a production environment.  It means that *any* website can make requests to your API, potentially allowing malicious websites to access or manipulate your data.

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with a list of specific, trusted origins:

```python
origins = [
    "http://localhost",  # Example for local development
    "http://localhost:8080",  # Example for local development with a different port
    "https://your-production-domain.com", #  Replace with your actual production domain
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins, # Use the defined origins list
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Why this is better:**

*   **Reduced Attack Surface:** By explicitly listing allowed origins, you limit the websites that can interact with your API.  This makes it much harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploits:**  Relaxed CORS settings can make XSS attacks more dangerous.  Limiting origins helps mitigate this risk.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  CORS is a crucial part of a robust security strategy. Specifying allowed origins is a necessary step.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Update the `origins` list:**  Replace the example domains in the `origins` list with the *actual* domains that your frontend applications are hosted on.  Don't leave the placeholder `https://your-production-domain.com` in production.
*   **Development vs. Production:** You can use environment variables to manage different CORS configurations for development and production:

    ```python
    import os

    origins = []

    if os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT") == "production":
        origins = [
            "https://your-production-domain.com",
            "https://another-trusted-domain.com",
        ]
    else:
        origins = [
            "http://localhost",
            "http://localhost:8080",
        ]

    app.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=origins,
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )
    ```

This allows you to use `allow_origins=["*"]` during local development (if absolutely necessary, but even then, specifying `localhost` is better) while enforcing stricter CORS policies in production.  Use a `.env` file or similar to set the `ENVIRONMENT` variable.
*   **Evaluate `allow_methods` and `allow_headers`:**  While limiting origins is the most critical fix here, carefully review `allow_methods=["*"]` and `allow_headers=["*"]` as well.  If you only need to support specific HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) or headers, restrict these accordingly to further reduce the attack surface.  For example, if you only accept `Content-Type: application/json`, explicitly allow only that header.
