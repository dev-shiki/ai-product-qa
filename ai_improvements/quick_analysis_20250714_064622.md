## Quick Insights

1. **Increase Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 source files, aim for higher test coverage. Focus on testing core business logic, boundary conditions, and error handling in each module. Consider tools like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage and identify gaps.

2. **Enforce Code Style:** Implement a consistent code style using a linter and formatter like `flake8` and `black`. This will improve readability and maintainability across the project. Configure these tools in a pre-commit hook to automatically enforce style rules.
