**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The primary security improvement is to **avoid hardcoding the `API_BASE_URL`** directly into the code.  Hardcoding sensitive configuration information (like URLs, API keys, etc.) is a significant vulnerability because:

1.  **Exposure in Source Control:**  If the code is committed to a public repository (e.g., GitHub), the URL is immediately exposed.
2.  **Difficult Configuration Management:**  Changing the URL requires modifying the code and redeploying the application. This is not ideal for different environments (development, staging, production).

The suggested improvement replaces the hardcoded URL with:

```python
API_BASE_URL = os.getenv("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
```

This line does the following:

*   **`os.getenv("API_BASE_URL")`:**  This attempts to read the value of the environment variable named `API_BASE_URL`. Environment variables are a standard way to configure applications without modifying the code.
*   **`"http://localhost:8000"`:** This is the *default value*. If the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable is *not* set, the code will fall back to using `http://localhost:8000`. This makes the application runnable locally without requiring any environment variable setup.  It's important that this default is a *safe* default; `localhost` is generally safe for local development.

**How to use the improved code:**

1.  **Set the environment variable:**  Before running the script in a production environment (or any environment other than purely local testing), you would set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable.  The exact way to do this depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  For example, in Linux/macOS, you might use:

    ```bash
    export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"
    ```

    In Windows:

    ```powershell
    $env:API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"
    ```

    Or through the Windows System Properties GUI.  In cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), you'll usually set environment variables through the platform's configuration settings.

2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**  When you run the Streamlit app, it will now read the `API_BASE_URL` from the environment.  If the environment variable is set, it will use that value. If it's not set, it will use the default `http://localhost:8000`.

This approach provides a much more secure and manageable way to handle configuration.
