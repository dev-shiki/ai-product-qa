## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os  # Import the os module

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

#  Read allowed origins from environment variables or a config file.
#  This prevents hardcoding the origins and allows for easier configuration changes without code modification.
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "").split(",")
if not ALLOWED_ORIGINS or ALLOWED_ORIGINS == ['']:
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8000"] # sensible default

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The original code used `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`.  This is a major security risk because it allows any website to make requests to your API.  This opens your API up to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and potentially other malicious activities.

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with a configuration that reads the allowed origins from an environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.  If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to `["http://localhost", "http://localhost:8000"]`.  This approach offers the following advantages:

1.  **Reduced Attack Surface:** Instead of allowing all origins, you explicitly define which origins are permitted to access your API.

2.  **Configuration Flexibility:**  You can easily change the allowed origins without modifying the code, simply by updating the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.  This is crucial for deployment in different environments (development, staging, production).

3.  **Security Best Practice:**  Hardcoding sensitive information (like allowed origins) is generally discouraged. Using environment variables allows for a more secure and manageable configuration.

**How to use the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:**

You would set the environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of allowed origins. For example, in a `.env` file (which is common for development):

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com,http://another-domain.com
```

Or on a Linux/macOS system in the terminal:

```bash
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"
```

On windows
```bash
set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com
```

When your FastAPI application starts, it will read this environment variable and configure the `CORSMiddleware` accordingly.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Production Environments:**  In a production environment,  *never* use `allow_origins=["*"]`.  Carefully define the specific origins that need to access your API.

*   **Environment Variables:**  Ensure your environment variables are securely managed and not exposed to unauthorized access.

*   **Input Validation:** Although not directly related to CORS, always validate and sanitize any user input to prevent other types of attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt communication between clients and your API.  This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
