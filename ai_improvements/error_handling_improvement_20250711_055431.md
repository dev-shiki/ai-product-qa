## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, status
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        if not products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail="No products found matching the criteria.")
        return products
    except ValueError as ve:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(ve))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in get_products: {e}") # Log the error for debugging
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve products.")

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        if not categories:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail="No categories found.")
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in get_categories: {e}") # Log the error for debugging
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve categories.")

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        if not products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=f"No products found for query: {query}")
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except ValueError as ve:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(ve))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in search_products: {e}") # Log the error for debugging
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to perform search.")

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        if not products:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail="No top-rated products found.")
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}

        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve top-rated products.")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Specific Exception Handling (ValueError):**  The code now specifically catches `ValueError` exceptions in `get_products` and `search_products`.  This is crucial because `ValueError` often indicates bad input data (e.g., an invalid category, limit, or search query).  By catching it, we can return a more informative 400 Bad Request error to the client, instead of a generic 500 Internal Server Error.  This helps the client understand that *they* made a mistake.

* **HTTP Status Codes:**  Using `fastapi.status` makes the code more readable and maintainable. The `HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST` and `HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` constants are much clearer than just `400` and `500`.

* **Logging:** Added `print(f"Unexpected error in...")` statements before raising the `HTTPException`.  This is **essential** for debugging.  Without logging, you only know an error *occurred*; you don't know *why*.  The logs will show you the full traceback, which is vital for identifying and fixing the underlying issue in the `product_service`.  Make sure your application's logging is configured to write these messages to a file or a logging service.  The logging should ideally use a dedicated logging library (like `logging` in Python).

* **Empty Result Handling (404 Not Found):**  The code now checks if the result from `product_service` is empty (e.g., no products matching the search criteria).  If it's empty, it raises an `HTTPException` with a 404 Not Found status code.  This is the correct HTTP status code to use when the server can't find a resource that matches the request.  The error message is more informative, telling the user why nothing was found.

* **Generic Error Message for 500:**  The `detail` message for the `HTTPException` raised in the `except Exception as e:` block is now a more generic "Failed to retrieve products." or similar.  It's generally considered bad practice to expose the exact error message from the backend to the client, especially in production.  This could reveal sensitive information or make your application more vulnerable to attacks.  The generic message is sufficient to inform the client that something went wrong on the server. The specific error is still available in the logs.

* **Specific error messages:** The HTTP_404 errors specify *why* nothing was found, providing useful information to the client.

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**  While not strictly an error handling issue, the repetitive structure of the `try...except` blocks suggests an opportunity for refactoring.  You could create a helper function to handle the common error handling logic.  However, I have not refactored it to keep focus on error handling *itself*.

This revised code addresses potential issues more robustly, provides better information to the client and significantly improves the debugging experience with the added logging.  The focus on specific exception types and appropriate HTTP status codes makes the API more reliable and user-friendly.
