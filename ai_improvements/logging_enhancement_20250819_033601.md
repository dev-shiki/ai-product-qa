```python

Service modules for the application.
""" 

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging (if not already configured)


def process_data(data):
    """
    Processes the input data.  This is just a placeholder function.

    Args:
        data: The data to process.

    Returns:
        The processed data (in this case, just the original data).
    """
    logging.info(f"Entering process_data function with data: {data}")

    try:
        # Simulate some data processing (replace with actual logic)
        processed_data = data 

        logging.debug(f"Successfully processed data.  Processed data: {processed_data}")  # More detailed log
        return processed_data

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error occurred during data processing: {e}", exc_info=True)  # Log the exception with traceback
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to propagate it (or handle it differently if needed)

    finally:
        logging.info("Exiting process_data function.")  # Always log on exit, even if error occurs
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Logging Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` is included at the top to ensure logging is properly configured.  Critically, it sets the logging level to `INFO`.  You should only call `basicConfig` *once* in your application.  A more robust approach in a larger application would be to read the logging level and format from a configuration file.  The `logging.basicConfig()` line should be removed if logging is already configured elsewhere in your application.

* **`logging.info` at Entry:**  Logs the function's entry point, including the input data.  This is invaluable for tracing execution flow and understanding what data the function is working with.

* **`logging.debug` for Details:**  Uses `logging.debug` to log more detailed information about the processing steps. Debug-level logging is very useful during development and troubleshooting, but it's often disabled in production to avoid excessive logging.

* **`try...except...finally` Block:**  The core logic is wrapped in a `try...except...finally` block for robust error handling.

* **`logging.error` on Exception:**  Logs any exceptions that occur, including the exception message *and the traceback* (`exc_info=True`).  The traceback is crucial for pinpointing the source of the error. The exception is then re-raised so that calling functions are aware of the error.

* **`logging.info` in `finally`:**  Logs the function's exit, regardless of whether an exception occurred.  This ensures that you always have a log entry indicating that the function has finished.

* **f-strings for Clear Messages:** Uses f-strings to create clear and readable log messages.

* **`exc_info=True` for Tracebacks:** The most important addition: `exc_info=True` when logging exceptions.  This captures the full traceback information, which is essential for debugging. Without it, you only get the exception message, which is often not enough to understand what went wrong.

How to use it:

```python
# Example usage (assuming the function is in a module called 'my_module')
#import my_module

try:
    result = process_data({"name": "example", "value": 123})
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

To see the log messages, you'll need to run your Python script in a way that displays standard output (usually just running it from the command line).  If you have configured a handler that writes log messages to a file instead of the console, then you'll need to view the log file.
