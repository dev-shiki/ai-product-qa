## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Since you have `app/utils/config.py`, consider formalizing configuration management.  Use a library like `pydantic-settings` to define your configuration schema and load values from environment variables or a `.env` file. This makes your application more flexible and deployable.

2.  **Code Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, check your code coverage.  Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure how much of your code is actually tested. Aim for 80%+ coverage to improve reliability and catch potential bugs.
