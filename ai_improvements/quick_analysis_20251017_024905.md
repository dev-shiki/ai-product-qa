# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:49:05  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project size (21 Python files, 8 tests) and a layered structure (app/api), two quick improvements are:

1.  **Introduce a Linter/Formatter:** Use a tool like Flake8, Pylint, or Black to enforce consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability and maintainability, especially as the project grows. Configure it to fail CI builds to maintain code quality.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage, especially within the `app/api` directory. Write tests specifically targeting the logic in `queries.py` and `products.py` to ensure API functionality and resilience.
