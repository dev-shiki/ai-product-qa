## Quick Insights

1. **Improve modularity and maintainability:**  Consider structuring `app/api` into smaller, more focused modules.  Instead of `queries.py` and `products.py`, explore dividing them based on specific query types or product categories to reduce file size and complexity.

2. **Ensure comprehensive testing:** A roughly 3:1 code-to-test ratio may indicate undertesting. Analyze the code coverage of your tests.  Prioritize testing complex logic, edge cases, and API interactions to prevent regressions and improve code reliability, especially in critical files like `app/main.py`.
