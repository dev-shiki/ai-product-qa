## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os  # Import the os module

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        extra = "forbid" # Forbid unexpected variables from environment file.

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY:
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set") # Removed the condition that looks for the default value. It can be useful during developoment, but it is not secure.
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file or environment variables") # Improved message.

@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The most important single security improvement is to add `extra = "forbid"` to the `Config` class within the `Settings` class.  This is a crucial step to prevent accidentally loading unexpected or malicious environment variables.

Here's why:

*   **Protection Against Unexpected Environment Variables:** The `extra = "forbid"` configuration option ensures that if any environment variables are present that are *not* defined as fields in the `Settings` class, Pydantic will raise a `ValueError`. This prevents your application from inadvertently picking up unintended configurations from the environment, which could potentially be manipulated by an attacker or cause unexpected behavior.  Without this, your application might silently accept extra variables, leading to security vulnerabilities or configuration conflicts.

* **Removal of default value check:** The code now checks if the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set at all, without checking if it is equal to the default value. This is more secure since we do not give to the possible attacker a default value to search for.

**Other minor improvements and reasoning:**

*   **Clearer Error Message:** The error message when `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is missing has been improved to specify that it must be set in the `.env` file or environment variables.
* **Remove comparison with default value:** Removed the check `self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here"`. This is because an attacker could use this information to find the default key and exploit the system.
*   **Import `os` module:** Although not strictly necessary in this code, importing the `os` module is often useful when working with environment variables and file paths.

By implementing these changes, the application's configuration loading process becomes significantly more robust and secure.
