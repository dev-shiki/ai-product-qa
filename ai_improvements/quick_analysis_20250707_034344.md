## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvements for your Python project:

1.  **Adopt a consistent code style:** Use a linter and formatter (like Flake8 with Black or Ruff) to enforce a unified style across all files. This dramatically improves readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects.

2.  **Improve test organization:** Group test files into a dedicated `tests/` directory instead of spreading them alongside the main application code. Structure tests to mirror the application structure (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py` for `app/api/products.py`). This makes tests easier to find and manage.
