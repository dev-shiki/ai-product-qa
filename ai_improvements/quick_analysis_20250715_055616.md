## Quick Insights

Given the size (21 source files, 8 test files), consider these improvements:

1.  **Enhance Module Organization:**  Further break down the `app` directory into sub-modules beyond `models`.  This improves code discoverability and maintainability as the project grows. Consider submodules for views, services, or utilities based on functionality.

2.  **Introduce Static Typing:** Gradually adopt type hints using `typing` module. Static typing improves code readability, helps catch errors early with tools like MyPy, and facilitates refactoring. Start by adding types to commonly used functions and data structures.
