## Quick Insights

1. **Implement a Linter/Formatter:** Employ a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` with a formatter like `black` or `autopep8`.  This enforces consistent coding style across all 29 files, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Automate this as a pre-commit hook to maintain code quality.

2. **Enhance Testing Structure:**  Move test files into a dedicated `tests/` directory alongside your `app/` directory, mirroring the application's structure. This enhances test discoverability and organization. Furthermore, consider using a testing framework like `pytest` for improved test discovery and features.
