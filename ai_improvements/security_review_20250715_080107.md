**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The primary security improvement addresses potential injection vulnerabilities within the `test_ask_question` function.  Specifically, it focuses on sanitizing the input `question` before sending it to the `/api/queries/ask` endpoint.

*   **Input Sanitization:**

    *   `json.dumps(question)`:  This line uses the `json.dumps()` method to serialize the `question` string into a JSON string. While `json.dumps` is primarily for JSON serialization, it has a crucial side effect that mitigates injection attacks.  It escapes special characters that could be maliciously crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the backend.  For example, if the backend database is vulnerable to SQL injection, or if the AI service is vulnerable to prompt injection,  escaping special characters prevents these characters from being interpreted as commands or code.
    *   This ensures that the `question` data is treated as a literal string when it is received by the backend, regardless of the actual content.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Injection Attacks:** Without sanitization, if the backend application directly uses the `question` string in a database query, AI prompt, or other sensitive operation, an attacker could inject malicious code into the question. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or other severe security issues.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Sanitizing input is a crucial part of a defense-in-depth strategy. Even if other security measures are in place, sanitization provides an additional layer of protection against unforeseen vulnerabilities.

**Other Considerations (Beyond the scope of "ONE" improvement but important for overall security):**

*   **Server-Side Validation:** The most robust defense is *always* on the server-side (the backend application). The server should validate and sanitize all incoming data before using it in any potentially dangerous operations.  This includes:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Checking that the input conforms to expected formats and constraints (e.g., length limits, allowed characters, data types).
    *   **Output Encoding:** Ensuring that data returned to the client is properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review the code and infrastructure for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive resources.
*   **Secure Configuration:**  Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) securely.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.

The provided code focuses on improving the security of the testing process, and this is valuable. However, remember that the ultimate responsibility for security lies with the implementation of the actual `app` and its backend services.
