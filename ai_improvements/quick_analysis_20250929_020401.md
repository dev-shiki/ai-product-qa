**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Structure & Discoverability:** With 21 files, consider grouping similar modules into sub-packages for better organization.  For example, group all API-related files (`queries.py`, `products.py`, etc.) into a dedicated `api` sub-package. This improves discoverability and maintainability.

2.  **Test Coverage:** 8 test files for 21 Python files *might* indicate insufficient test coverage.  Analyze code coverage reports (using `pytest-cov`) to identify untestable areas and prioritize writing tests for crucial or complex modules. Aim for a higher percentage of covered code, especially in critical functionalities.
