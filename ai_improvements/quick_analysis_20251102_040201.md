**Time**: 04:02:01  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Introduce a Linter and Formatter:**  With 21 Python files, consistently enforcing coding style becomes crucial.  Employ a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` to maintain code quality, readability, and reduce stylistic debates during code reviews. Automate this as part of your CI/CD pipeline for continuous style enforcement.

2. **Improve Testing Structure:**  Having only 8 test files for 21 source files suggests potential gaps in test coverage. Investigate using coverage tools to identify untested areas. Consider organizing tests mirroring your directory structure (e.g., `./tests/api/test_queries.py`) for better maintainability and discoverability.
