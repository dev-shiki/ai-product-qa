# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:24:20  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Consistent Naming & Structure:** Standardize file naming conventions (e.g., snake_case) and directory structure. Given "app/api/queries.py" and "app/api/products.py", consider grouping similar files within subdirectories. This improves readability and maintainability, especially as the project grows.

2. **Linting & Code Style:** Implement a linter (like Flake8) and code formatter (like Black) to enforce consistent code style across all 21 Python files. This reduces stylistic debates and improves code readability, contributing to better collaboration and fewer bugs.
