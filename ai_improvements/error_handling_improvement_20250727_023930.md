Key improvements in error handling:

1. **Specific Exception Handling:**  Instead of a generic `except Exception as e`, the code now explicitly catches `ValueError` and `KeyError` that are most likely to occur when parsing the JSON data.  This is crucial because it allows you to handle expected errors gracefully while letting truly unexpected errors propagate (which is often the right thing to do during development, as it reveals underlying problems).

2. **Informative Error Messages:** The `print(f"Error reading products from JSON: {e}")`  provides specific information about the error that occurred.  This is essential for debugging and understanding the root cause of the problem.  In a production environment, you'd replace `print` with proper logging.

3. **Graceful Degradation:**  Instead of crashing or raising an exception that might halt the application, the code now returns `{"products": []}` when an error occurs during JSON parsing.  This allows the application to continue running, albeit with an empty product list.  Whether this is the appropriate behavior depends on the application's requirements.  In some cases, re-raising the exception might be better (if a missing product list is fatal).

4. **Catch-all for unexpected errors:** An additional `except Exception as e` block has been added as a failsafe after the specific exception handlers to catch any unforeseen issues. This block is crucial for preventing the application from crashing due to unexpected errors that might occur during the JSON parsing process, and it logs an informative message to aid in debugging.

5. **Testing for Error Cases:**  The added pytest tests specifically target the error scenarios. This ensures that the error handling logic is actually working as intended.

6. **Mocking for Robustness:**  The code now uses a `MockLocalProductService` to avoid actual file I/O during testing. This makes the tests faster, more reliable, and independent of the file system.  It also allows you to easily simulate different file contents (including invalid JSON).

7. **Input Validation:** The mock implementation now includes checks to ensure that the JSON data is a dictionary, contains a "products" key, and that the "products" value is a list.  These checks prevent unexpected behavior caused by invalid input.

How to choose between returning empty list vs. re-raising:

* **Return empty list:**  If the application can function reasonably well even without the product data (e.g., it can display a message like "No products available"), then returning an empty list is a good choice. This provides a smoother user experience by preventing a crash.

* **Re-raise the exception:**  If the application *cannot* function correctly without the product data (e.g., the product list is essential for its core functionality), then re-raising the exception is the better option. This will halt the application and alert the developers to the problem, preventing potentially corrupted data or incorrect behavior.  You would typically log the exception *before* re-raising it.  For example:

```python
        except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
            print(f"Error reading products from JSON: {e}")  # Log the exception
            raise  # Re-raise the exception
```

Remember to replace `print` with a proper logging mechanism in a production environment.  The logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python) allows you to control the severity level of the messages (e.g., `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) and to direct the logs to different destinations (e.g., files, databases, monitoring systems).
