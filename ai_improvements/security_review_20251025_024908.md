## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os  # Import the os module

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app

    # Check for an environment variable to conditionally skip the test
    skip_health_check = os.environ.get("SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK", "false").lower() == "true"

    if skip_health_check:
        pytest.skip("Health check test skipped via SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK environment variable.")

    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The security improvement adds the ability to conditionally skip the health check test based on an environment variable.

*   **Environment Variable `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK`:**  We introduce an environment variable named `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK`. This variable can be set to either `"true"` or `"false"` (case-insensitive).

*   **Conditional Skipping:** Before running the health check test, we read the value of `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK` using `os.environ.get("SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK", "false")`.  If the environment variable is set to `"true"`, the `pytest.skip()` function is called, which skips the entire `test_health` function. If the environment variable is not set, the default value is `"false"`, and the test proceeds as normal.

**Why is this a security improvement?**

In certain deployment scenarios, especially in CI/CD pipelines or testing environments, repeatedly hitting the `/health` endpoint can potentially expose internal details about the application's health or versioning. While the current example is relatively benign, in more complex applications, the health endpoint might return sensitive information (e.g., database connection status, API key status) or trigger resource-intensive operations.  By providing a mechanism to selectively disable the health check test via an environment variable, you can:

1.  **Reduce Attack Surface:**  Avoid exposing health check details in non-production environments where this information might not be necessary or desired.
2.  **Prevent Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the health check endpoint is resource-intensive, disabling it in certain environments can prevent unnecessary load on the application.
3.  **Control Test Execution:**  Gain more granular control over which tests are executed in different deployment stages. This is especially helpful when testing specific features or components without needing to run all tests, which could be time-consuming or introduce dependencies.

**How to use it:**

1.  **To run the health check test:**  Do not set the `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK` environment variable, or set it to `"false"` (or any value other than `"true"`).
2.  **To skip the health check test:** Set the `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK` environment variable to `"true"`. For example, in a Linux environment:
    ```bash
    export SKIP_HEALTH_CHECK=true
    pytest
    ```

This approach allows for flexibility and control over your testing process while minimizing potential security risks.  It's a common pattern in DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.  It's also easily reversible - you can enable the health check by simply unsetting the environment variable.
