## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

# Configure logging (adjust level and format as needed)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    logging.info("Starting test_get_products")
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logging.debug("Sending GET request to /api/products/")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
        logging.debug(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logging.debug(f"Response data: {data}")

    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)
    logging.info("test_get_products passed successfully")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  The `import logging` statement is crucial to use the logging module.
* **Basic Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig(...)` sets up the logging system.  Critically, it sets the level to `logging.DEBUG`.  This means *all* log messages at DEBUG level or higher (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be emitted.  Without this, you might not see any output, especially if the default level is higher. The format string specifies the structure of the log messages (timestamp, level, message).  You can customize this as needed.
* **Strategic Logging:**  I've added `logging.info` and `logging.debug` statements at key points in the function:
    * **Start of the test:**  Logs when the test begins.
    * **Before sending the request:** Logs the URL being requested.  This is vital for debugging network issues.
    * **After receiving the response:** Logs the status code.  This is another crucial piece of information.
    * **After parsing the JSON:** Logs the data to inspect what was received.
    * **End of the test:** Logs when the test has passed, to ensure every thing work as expected.
* **`logging.debug` vs. `logging.info`:**  I've used `logging.debug` for detailed information (like the actual data received) and `logging.info` for more general events.  The choice of level depends on what information is most useful during debugging.
* **f-strings:** Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}"`) makes it easy to embed variable values in your log messages.
* **Error Handling (Potential):**  For more robust logging, you might want to add `try...except` blocks around the code that makes network requests or parses JSON to catch potential exceptions and log them using `logging.exception`.

How to run with logging output:

1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above to a file, e.g., `test_products.py`.  Make sure the file is in a directory where pytest can find it (e.g., the project root, or a `tests` directory). Also, create the `app` directory and add the `main.py` and `api/products/product_service.py` or any other modules that needed to be mocked.  This avoids import errors.
2.  **Run pytest:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your test file, and run `pytest -v`. The `-v` option increases verbosity, which is helpful for seeing the test results and the logging output in detail.  If you haven't installed pytest, install it with `pip install pytest`.

Now, when you run the tests, you will see the logging output interleaved with the pytest results in your console.  This will give you valuable insights into what's happening during the test execution.  Adapt the logging levels and messages to suit your specific debugging needs.
