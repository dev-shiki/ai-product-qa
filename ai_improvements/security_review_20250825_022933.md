**Security Improvement:**  **Password Hashing with Salt**

**Explanation:**

The most critical security improvement is to **never store passwords in plain text**. Instead, store a cryptographic hash of the password along with a unique salt for each user.

1.  **`hash_password(password: str)` Function:**
    *   **Salt Generation:**  `secrets.token_hex(16)` generates a cryptographically secure random salt. A salt is a random string added to the password before hashing.  This is extremely important.
    *   **Hashing:** `hashlib.sha256()`  creates a SHA-256 hash of the salted password.  SHA-256 is a widely-used cryptographic hash function. You could consider using more modern algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
    *   **Encoding:** The code encodes the password and salt to bytes using UTF-8 encoding before hashing. This is important for consistency and security.
    *   **Returns:** Returns the `password_hash` and the `salt` as a tuple.

2.  **`verify_password(self, password: str)` Function:**
    *   Takes the user-provided password as input.
    *   Combines it with the user's stored `salt`.  It is crucial that each user has a unique salt.  Storing the same salt for all users defeats the purpose of salting.
    *   Hashes the combined password and salt using the same SHA-256 algorithm.
    *   Compares the resulting hash with the stored `password_hash`.  If they match, the password is correct.

3.  **Storing `password_hash` and `salt`:**
    *   The `User` dataclass now includes `password_hash` and `salt` attributes to store the hashed password and salt.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Protection against rainbow table attacks:** Salting prevents attackers from using precomputed tables of password hashes (rainbow tables) to quickly crack passwords.  Because each password has a unique salt, the attacker would need to generate a separate rainbow table for each user, which is computationally infeasible.
*   **Protection against dictionary attacks:**  Salting makes dictionary attacks more difficult. Even if multiple users choose the same password, their salted hashes will be different.
*   **Data Breach Mitigation:**  If the database is compromised, attackers will only have access to the password hashes and salts, not the plain text passwords.  While cracking the hashes is still possible, it's much harder and time-consuming, giving the organization time to respond.
*   **Stronger Security:** SHA-256 (or bcrypt/Argon2) is a one-way function, meaning it's computationally infeasible to reverse the hash and recover the original password.

**Additional Considerations and Best Practices:**

*   **Use bcrypt or Argon2:**  SHA-256, while better than storing plain text passwords, is relatively fast to compute.  Modern password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 are designed to be slow, which makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult.  They also include built-in salting.  You would typically use a library like `bcrypt` in Python.
*   **Regular Password Rotation:**  Encourage or enforce regular password changes by users.
*   **Password Complexity Requirements:**  Enforce password complexity requirements (minimum length, uppercase/lowercase, numbers, symbols) to make it harder for users to choose weak passwords.
*   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Implement 2FA for an added layer of security.
*   **Secure Storage of Salts and Hashes:** Ensure that the salts and hashes are stored securely in the database and that access to the database is properly controlled.
*   **Avoid Transmitting Passwords in Plain Text:**  Always use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt the connection between the client and server when transmitting passwords.
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate user input on both the client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks.  Specifically, sanitize the username and email address.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks.

This improved data model provides a more secure way to handle user passwords, reducing the risk of data breaches and protecting user accounts. It's an essential security practice for any application that handles sensitive user information.
