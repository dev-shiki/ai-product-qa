## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Centralize Configuration:** Abstract application settings (like database connection strings, API keys) into a configuration file (e.g., using `configparser` or a library like `pydantic` for validation). This simplifies management and deployment, preventing hardcoding sensitive information.

2.  **Implement Linting and Formatting:**  Introduce a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black` or `autopep8`). This ensures consistent code style and identifies potential errors early on, improving code readability and maintainability across all files.
