```

**Improvement:** Instead of asserting only presence of keys, assert that the returned data matches the expected data. This prevents against accidental data leakage or unexpected values.

**Explanation:**

The original tests only checked for the *presence* of keys like `"id"` and `"name"` in the returned JSON data.  This is insufficient for ensuring data integrity and security. A malicious actor or a simple programming error could introduce extra, sensitive data fields into the API response, and these tests would not detect it.

The improved code changes the assertion to directly compare the entire returned JSON object with a pre-defined `EXPECTED_PRODUCT`.  This ensures that:

1.  **No unexpected fields are present:** The API response contains *only* the expected data, preventing information leakage.
2.  **Values are as expected:** The values associated with each key are exactly as anticipated, guarding against data corruption or manipulation.

By doing a direct comparison of the entire JSON object, the tests are much more robust and provide greater assurance that the API is behaving as intended and not inadvertently exposing sensitive information.  This makes the tests more secure. I have added this improvement in each of the provided tests. Using constants for expected values also improves maintainability and auditability.
