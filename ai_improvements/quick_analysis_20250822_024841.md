**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Consider a linter and formatter:** Integrate a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black` into your workflow. This enforces code style consistency across all 21 Python files, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Use pre-commit hooks to automate this process before each commit.

2. **Assess test coverage:** With 8 test files, investigate your test coverage. Tools like `pytest-cov` can highlight which parts of your code are untested. Aim for a reasonable coverage target (e.g., 80%) to increase confidence in your codebase, especially in crucial areas like `api/queries.py` and `api/products.py`.
