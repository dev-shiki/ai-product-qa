    Wrapper function to handle exceptions gracefully.

    Args:
        func: The function to execute.
        *args: Positional arguments to pass to the function.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the function.

    Returns:
        The result of the function call, or None if an exception occurred.  Also returns a boolean is_success,
        it is recommended that is_success be checked.

    Raises:
        Any exceptions caught are logged, but not re-raised.

    Example:
        result, success = safe_operation(int, "123")

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`safe_operation` Function:**  This is the core improvement.  It's a generic error handling wrapper.  This avoids repeating `try...except` blocks for every function call that might raise an exception.  It now returns a tuple `(result, success)` making it explicit whether the operation succeeded. The user must now check for the success boolean, making it less likely the user will not check for an error.
* **Logging:**  Uses the `logging` module to record exceptions.  This is *crucial* for debugging and monitoring.  The `logger.exception()` method automatically includes the traceback in the log message, making it much easier to diagnose the root cause of errors.  The `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` line is added in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block as an example.  You'll need to configure logging properly for your application (e.g., writing to a file, different log levels).  I chose `INFO` as a reasonable default, but you might prefer `DEBUG` during development.
* **Specific Exception Handling in `read_file_content`:** Demonstrates how to handle common file-related exceptions (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError) specifically.  This allows you to provide more informative error messages or take different actions based on the type of error.
* **Return Values:**  `read_file_content` now returns `None` (or appropriate defaults) when an error occurs.  It also returns a `success` boolean, so the caller knows that the function failed and can take appropriate action.
* **Clarity and Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each part and how to use the error handling mechanisms.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__':` Example:**  This provides a complete, runnable example of how to use the improved functions and error handling. It demonstrates both successful and error cases.
* **Avoids Re-raising Exceptions (by default):**  The `safe_operation` function *logs* the exception but doesn't re-raise it.  This is a design choice.  In some cases, you might want to re-raise a *custom* exception after logging, to provide more context to the calling code.  I've added a comment in `safe_operation` to show how to do this.  The current implementation assumes that the caller is responsible for handling the error after `safe_operation` returns.

How to use the `safe_operation` wrapper effectively:

1.  **Identify functions that might raise exceptions:**  Think about any function call that could potentially fail (e.g., file I/O, network requests, database queries, calculations that might lead to division by zero, etc.).
2.  **Wrap the function call:** Use `safe_operation(func, *args, **kwargs)` to call the function.
3.  **Check the return value:**  After calling `safe_operation`, *always* check the `success` boolean value to see if the function executed successfully.
4.  **Handle the error (if any):** If the function failed, log the error (it's already logged in `safe_operation` but you might want to add more context), return an appropriate default value, or take other error-handling actions.

Example Usage Scenarios
* **Data Validation:**  Wrap a function that validates user input to handle `ValueError` or other validation exceptions.  If validation fails, log the error and return an error message to the user.
* **Database Operations:**  Wrap database query functions to handle `OperationalError` or other database-related exceptions.  If the query fails, log the error, retry the query (possibly with exponential backoff), or return an error message to the user.
* **API Calls:** Wrap functions that make API calls to handle network errors, timeouts, or invalid API responses.  If the API call fails, log the error, retry the call, or return a default value.

This improved version provides a more robust and maintainable approach to error handling in your utility modules.  Remember to configure logging appropriately for your application.  The `safe_operation` function is a powerful tool for simplifying error handling and preventing unhandled exceptions from crashing your application.
