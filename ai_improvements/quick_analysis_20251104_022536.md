## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions:

1.  **Centralize Configuration:** If configuration is scattered across multiple files, consider creating a dedicated configuration module (e.g., `app/config.py`). This will improve maintainability and make it easier to manage settings like API keys, database connection strings, and feature flags.

2.  **Implement Logging:** Add robust logging throughout the application, using a standard logging library. This will significantly aid in debugging, monitoring, and auditing the application's behavior, especially in a production environment. Consider logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
