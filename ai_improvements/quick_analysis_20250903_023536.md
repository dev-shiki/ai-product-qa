## Quick Insights

1. **Improve modularity & reduce `app/main.py` complexity:** Break down `app/main.py` into smaller, more focused modules. Move related logic (e.g., input validation, data processing) into separate files/classes within the `app` directory.  This promotes code reusability and makes the main entry point easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Enforce consistent style with a linter/formatter:**  Implement a linter (like pylint or flake8) and a formatter (like black) to enforce a consistent code style across all 21 Python files. This improves readability and reduces the likelihood of style-related errors during code reviews. Integrate this into a pre-commit hook to automatically format/lint code before committing.
