# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:38:01  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure (21 source files, 8 test files), consider these improvements:

1.  **Introduce a linter and formatter (e.g., pylint, black).** With 21 files, code style inconsistencies are likely. Linters enforce style guides and catch errors, while formatters automatically standardize code. Consistent code improves readability and maintainability across the project.

2.  **Implement a basic continuous integration (CI) setup.** With existing tests, a CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) can automatically run these tests on every code change. This provides rapid feedback on code quality and prevents regressions, crucial for a project of this size.
