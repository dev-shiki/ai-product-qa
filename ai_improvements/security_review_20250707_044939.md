**Explanation of the Improvement:**

The primary security improvement addresses a potential issue with asynchronous execution and loop management, which can lead to deadlocks or unexpected behavior, especially within web applications.  Specifically, within the `search_products` method, the event loop is retrieved and then used to run the `local_service.search_products` method in a separate executor.  The problem occurs if the asyncio event loop is closed or corrupted.

**Reasoning and Mitigation:**

1. **Robust Event Loop Handling:**

   - **Check Loop Status:** The added code `if loop.is_closed():` checks if the currently retrieved event loop is closed.  If it is, it means the loop is not active and cannot be used safely for asynchronous operations.  This avoids potential runtime errors from trying to execute tasks in a closed loop.

   - **Create a New Loop:** If the loop is closed, a new event loop is created using `loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()`.  This ensures that the `run_in_executor` call will execute within a valid asynchronous context.

   - **Set the Current Loop:** After creating a new loop, `asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)` is called.  This is **crucial**.  It sets the newly created loop as the current loop in the current context. Without this, the asynchronous operations within the `search_products` method may still try to use the old, closed loop, leading to errors.

**Why This Is a Security Improvement:**

While not a direct vulnerability exploitation fix, ensuring correct event loop management contributes to overall application stability and reliability.  Unstable or unpredictable behavior caused by improper asynchronous handling can create unexpected states within the application. This can indirectly increase the risk of security vulnerabilities. A stable and predictable application is far easier to secure and reason about.  By guarding against corrupted event loops, this code helps prevent cascading failures which can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios, data corruption, or unpredictable application behavior which can be exploited.  Proper event loop handling also promotes cleaner resource management preventing memory leaks that could be exploited.

**In summary:** The added `if loop.is_closed():` block with loop recreation and setting as the current loop is a preventative measure that enhances the robustness and stability of the code, indirectly strengthening its security posture. Without proper event loop management, there could be unpredictable errors which could indirectly be exploited.
