```python

from datetime import datetime
import time
import os  # Import the os module

# Configuration
# Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
# Check if API_BASE_URL is None and provide a default if it is.  This prevents the app from crashing if the environment variable is not set.
if API_BASE_URL is None:
    API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000" # Default Value

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The most critical security improvement here is to **store the `API_BASE_URL` in an environment variable**.

*   **Why it's important:**  Hardcoding sensitive information like API endpoints (especially if they point to internal or non-public resources) directly into your code is a major security risk. If your code is ever committed to a public repository or otherwise exposed, attackers can easily discover the API endpoint.

*   **How it works:**

    1.  **`import os`:** We import the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, including accessing environment variables.

    2.  **`API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`:**
        *   `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL")`: This attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable named "API_BASE_URL".  Environment variables are key-value pairs set at the operating system level.
        *   `"http://localhost:8000"`: This is the *default value*.  If the "API_BASE_URL" environment variable is *not* set, the code will fall back to using "http://localhost:8000".  This is important for local development or testing.  It allows the application to run without requiring the environment variable to be set in all cases.
        *   Using `os.environ.get` rather than direct indexing (e.g. `os.environ["API_BASE_URL"]`) is crucial.  If you try to access an environment variable that doesn't exist using direct indexing, your program will crash with a `KeyError`.  `os.environ.get` returns `None` if the variable is not found, allowing you to handle the case gracefully.

    3. **`if API_BASE_URL is None:`**:  This condition checks if the value retrieved from the environment variable is `None`.  This can occur if the environment variable is not set.  This provides a secondary safety net to ensure a default value is used.

*   **How to set environment variables (examples):**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"
        ```

    *   **Windows:**

        ```powershell
        $env:API_BASE_URL = "https://your-production-api.com"
        ```

    *   **Streamlit Cloud/Deployment Platforms:** Most deployment platforms (like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, AWS, etc.) have a mechanism for setting environment variables through their web interface or command-line tools.  This is the preferred method for production deployments.

**Why this is the BEST single security improvement given the code:**

While other security measures *could* be taken (input validation, rate limiting, authentication, etc.), protecting the API endpoint itself is the most fundamental.  If an attacker knows the API endpoint, they can potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the backend API, even if the Streamlit app itself is secure.  Protecting this sensitive information is the most crucial first step.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Never commit your environment variables to source control!**  Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude files that contain environment variables (e.g., `.env` files).
*   Consider using a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for more sensitive API keys or credentials.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure that the API endpoint (`API_BASE_URL`) uses HTTPS to encrypt communication between the Streamlit app and the API server.  This protects data in transit.  If `http://localhost:8000` is used, it is only for local development.  In production, a secure HTTPS endpoint must be used.
