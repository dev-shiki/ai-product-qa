## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (basic configuration for demonstration)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    logger.info(f"get_products endpoint called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Error occurred while retrieving products.") # log the exception with traceback
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:** The `logging` module is now imported.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up basic logging.  This is crucial; without it, your log messages won't be displayed.  You'll likely want a more sophisticated configuration in a real application (e.g., writing to files, different log levels, custom formatters).
* **Logger Instance:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance specific to this module.  This is best practice, allowing you to configure logging on a per-module basis. Using `__name__` ensures that the logger is named after the module, making it easy to identify the source of log messages.
* **Logging at the Start and End:** `logger.info(f"get_products endpoint called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")` logs when the function is called, including the input parameters. This is extremely valuable for debugging.  `logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")` logs the number of products retrieved *before* returning them, which confirms the function executed successfully.
* **Exception Logging:**  `logger.exception("Error occurred while retrieving products.")` is the most important addition.  It logs the exception *and* the traceback, providing critical information for diagnosing errors.  Critically, it's used *before* re-raising the exception.  If you only re-raise the exception, you lose the traceback information unless you specifically handle it elsewhere.
* **Log Levels:**  `logger.info` is used for general information. `logger.exception` is automatically set to the ERROR level and also includes traceback info.  Consider using `logger.debug` for more detailed information that is only useful during development.

This revised answer provides a robust logging implementation that will significantly aid in debugging and monitoring your application.  Remember to configure your logging properly for a production environment (e.g., using a configuration file and rotating log files).
