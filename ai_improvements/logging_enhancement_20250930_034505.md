## Improvement

```python
import logging
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging

def test_product_specifications():
    logging.info("Starting test_product_specifications")
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    logging.info(f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5, "Rating assertion failed"
    logging.info("Rating assertion passed")
    assert spec.sold == 100, "Sold assertion failed"
    logging.info("Sold assertion passed")
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta", "Shop location assertion failed"
    logging.info("Shop location assertion passed")
    assert spec.color == "Hitam", "Color assertion failed"
    logging.info("Color assertion passed")
    logging.info("test_product_specifications completed successfully")

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Logging Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` is crucial.  Without this, you won't see any log messages.  This sets the logging level to INFO, so INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL messages will be displayed.  Consider using `logging.DEBUG` for more detailed debugging output.  This should usually be done *outside* of the test functions themselves, at the top of the file or in a setup function.
* **Informative Log Messages:** The log messages are now more descriptive, indicating what's being tested and the values involved.  This makes debugging much easier.  Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}"`) allows you to easily include variable values in your log messages.
* **Assertion Logging:**  Log messages are included *after* each assertion to confirm that the assertion passed.  Crucially, the assertion also has a message attached to it. This helps pinpoint exactly which assertion failed, and why.
* **Clear Start/End Markers:**  `logging.info("Starting test_product_specifications")` and `logging.info("test_product_specifications completed successfully")` clearly mark the beginning and end of the test function's execution.
* **Error Handling (Implicit):**  If an assertion fails, the test will halt, and the last log message before the failure will give you a strong hint as to what went wrong. Consider wrapping the whole function in a try/except block to log the error in more detail.

How to Run with Logging:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_products.py`).
2.  **Run:** Execute the file from your terminal: `python test_products.py`

You'll see the log messages printed to your console, showing the progress and results of the test.  If an assertion fails, the traceback will still be displayed, but the log messages will provide additional context.
