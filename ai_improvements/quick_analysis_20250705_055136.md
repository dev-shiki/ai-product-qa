## Quick Insights

1. **Implement a comprehensive linting and formatting setup.** Use tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This will improve readability, reduce errors, and simplify collaboration. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks on every commit.

2. **Ensure robust testing coverage.** While you have 8 test files, focus on achieving high code coverage (ideally >80%). Use a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to identify untested areas and write unit tests for critical functions and edge cases, especially in core logic within `app/api/products.py` and `app/main.py`.
