# Logging Enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging statements to. I need the code of the function to be able to add appropriate logging.

For example, if you provide me with:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y
```

I can then provide you with the function with logging:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging (do this once, ideally at the module level)

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")
  return result
```

I've added logging statements to show the input values and the calculated result.  The exact logging statements you'll need depend on the function's purpose and what information is most valuable to track.

**General Guidelines for Adding Logging:**

*   **Import `logging`:**  `import logging`
*   **Configure Logging (once, usually at module level):** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` or use a `logging.config` file.  The `level` determines which messages get printed (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
*   **Log at the start and end:** Log entry and exit points to understand the flow of execution.
*   **Log important values:**  Log the values of key variables, especially inputs and outputs.
*   **Use appropriate log levels:**
    *   `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging (e.g., intermediate calculations).
    *   `INFO`: General information about the application's operation (e.g., function calls, state changes).
    *   `WARNING`: Potential problems or unusual conditions (e.g., retries).
    *   `ERROR`: Errors that prevent a function from completing its task.
    *   `CRITICAL`: Severe errors that may lead to application termination.
*   **Use f-strings or `.format()`:** To embed variable values in log messages.
*   **Consider logging exceptions:**  `logging.exception("An error occurred:")` logs the exception message and traceback.

**Example Logging Levels and Use Cases:**

*   `logging.debug(f"Variable x: {x}")` :  Useful for debugging, showing intermediate values within a calculation.
*   `logging.info(f"User logged in: {username}")` : Information about user activity, suitable for monitoring.
*   `logging.warning(f"Disk space low: {disk_usage}")` :  Alerting about potential problems that might not be immediately critical.
*   `logging.error(f"Failed to connect to database: {e}")` : Indicating a function could not complete a task due to an error.
*   `logging.critical("Application shutting down due to memory error")` :  Alerting about a severe and unrecoverable error.

Waiting for your function code!
