# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Instead of redefining `mock_json_data` within the `@pytest.fixture` decorator, consider loading it from a JSON file.

**Explanation:**

Defining the large `mock_json_data` directly within the code makes the file long and less readable.  Moving it to a separate JSON file (`mock_data.json`) keeps the test code cleaner and allows for easier modification of the mock data without directly changing the Python code.  This also makes the code more maintainable.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def mock_json_data():
    """Mock JSON data for testing"""
    data_path = Path(__file__).parent / "mock_data.json"  # Assuming mock_data.json is in the same directory
    with open(data_path, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

Create a `mock_data.json` file containing the JSON data you previously had in your Python code.
