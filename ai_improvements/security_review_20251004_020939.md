**Explanation of Improvement:**

The key security improvement is related to ensuring proper `.env` file permissions. The added `customise_sources` within `Config` class doesn't add any functionalities but it indicates that the configuration loading process can be customized. In order to ensure `.env` file permissions, outside this code, you need to ensure that the `.env` file has restrictive permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 .env` on Linux/Unix systems).

**Why is this important?**

*   **Protection of Sensitive Information:** The `.env` file often contains highly sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets. If the file has overly permissive access rights (e.g., readable by all users on the system), an attacker could potentially gain access to these secrets and compromise the application.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Following the principle of least privilege, the `.env` file should only be readable by the user account that the application runs under, and ideally only writable by the administrative user who deploys or manages the application.

**How to implement proper .env file permissions (example for Linux/Unix):**

1.  **Identify the user:** Determine the user account that your application will run under (e.g., `www-data`, `nginx`, or a dedicated user account).
2.  **Change ownership (if needed):** If the `.env` file is not owned by the correct user, change ownership:

    ```bash
    sudo chown <user>:<group> .env  # Where <user> is the application's user, and <group> is its group
    ```

3.  **Set restrictive permissions:**  Restrict read/write access to only the owner:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 600 .env
    ```

With these permissions, only the owner of the `.env` file (the application's user) can read and write to it.  Other users on the system will not have access.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Deployment:**  When deploying your application, ensure that the `.env` file is transferred to the server securely (e.g., using `scp` or `rsync` over SSH) and that the correct permissions are set on the server.
*   **Version Control:**  **Never** commit your `.env` file to version control (e.g., Git).  Add it to your `.gitignore` file.  This is crucial to prevent accidentally exposing secrets to a public repository.
*   **Alternatives:**  For more complex deployments, consider using more robust secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or other similar tools. These tools provide centralized storage, access control, and auditing of secrets.

By implementing these precautions, you significantly reduce the risk of sensitive information being compromised and improve the overall security of your application.
