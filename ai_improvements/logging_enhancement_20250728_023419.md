# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/utils/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 02:34:19  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you would like me to add logging to.  I need the code of the function to be able to modify it and add logging statements.

For example, you could give me something like this:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together."""
  return x + y
```

Then I could return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is {result}")
  return result
```

Once you provide the function, I will provide a version with logging added.  I will use the `logging` module and include INFO level logs to show the function's inputs and outputs. I'll assume basic configuration (logging to console at INFO level) if you don't specify otherwise. If you have specific logging requirements (level, format, destination), please let me know.
