@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1, description="Maximum number of products to return. Must be between 1 and 100"),
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,

        )

    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

        return {"categories": categories}

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

**Input Validation and Limiting via `Query` with `le` and `ge`:**

The primary vulnerability addressed is the potential for Denial-of-Service (DoS) or resource exhaustion through unbounded limits on the `limit` parameter in the `get_products`, `search_products`, and `get_top_rated_products` endpoints.  An attacker could specify a very large `limit` value, causing the server to attempt to retrieve and process an excessive amount of data, potentially overwhelming the system and making it unresponsive.

The solution is to use FastAPI's `Query` parameter to enforce limits on the acceptable range of the `limit` parameter.

*   `Query(default_value, le=max_value, ge=min_value)` is used to define query parameters with validation constraints.
*   `le=100` specifies that the `limit` parameter must be less than or equal to 100 (for `/` endpoint) and `le=50` for the rest.
*   `ge=1` specifies that the `limit` parameter must be greater than or equal to 1.  This prevents a zero or negative limit.
*   `description` provides documentation for the API consumer.

By implementing these checks, we ensure that the server only processes requests with reasonable `limit` values, mitigating the risk of DoS attacks and improving the overall security and stability of the application.  This is a crucial input validation step.
