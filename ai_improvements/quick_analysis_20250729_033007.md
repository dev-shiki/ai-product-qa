## Quick Insights

Given the size (21 Python files, 8 test files), consider these improvements:

1. **Enforce code style with a linter and formatter (e.g., `flake8`, `black`).** Consistent styling improves readability and maintainability across the project. Implement pre-commit hooks to automate checks.

2. **Implement type hints.**  Adding type hints will improve code clarity and catch potential errors early in development by enabling static analysis with tools like `mypy`. This also enhances code understanding for developers.
