## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** Use a tool like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This improves readability and reduces potential errors. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.

2.  **Increase test coverage:**  With 8 test files and 21 Python files, aim for higher code coverage. Focus on testing core logic, boundary conditions, and error handling. Use coverage tools to identify untested code and write more tests to ensure robustness.
