**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the structure, consider these improvements:

1.  **Enforce code style consistency:**  Employ a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and formatter (like Black) to ensure consistent code style across all 21 files.  This improves readability and reduces code review friction.  Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve test coverage:**  With only 8 test files covering potentially complex application logic, aim for better test coverage.  Use coverage tools to identify untested code paths. Prioritize testing API endpoints thoroughly, especially given `products.py`.
