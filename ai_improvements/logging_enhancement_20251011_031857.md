# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_queries.py`  
**Time**: 03:18:57  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.queries.product_service")
async def test_get_brands(mock_service):
    logger.info("Starting test_get_brands")
    mock_service.get_brands.return_value = ["Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"]
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/queries/brands")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
        logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")
    assert "brands" in data
    assert set(data["brands"]) >= {"Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"}
    logger.info("test_get_brands completed successfully")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially, the `logging` module is imported. This was missing in the original request, preventing the code from actually logging anything.
* **Logger Initialization:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance specifically for this module. This allows for more granular control and filtering of logs.  The `__name__` ensures that the logs are associated with the test module, making debugging easier.
* **Informative Log Messages:**
    * `logger.info("Starting test_get_brands")`:  Logs the start of the test.  `info` level is used for general information.
    * `logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/queries/brands")`: Logs before the network request, indicating what action is being performed.
    * `logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")`: Logs the HTTP status code of the response. This is essential for quickly identifying errors.
    * `logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")`: Logs the full response data.  `debug` level is used because the response data can be verbose and is only needed for detailed debugging.  This makes use of an f-string for easy variable insertion.
    * `logger.info("test_get_brands completed successfully")`:  Logs the successful completion of the test.
* **Appropriate Log Levels:**  `info` and `debug` log levels are used appropriately.  `debug` is for detailed information that you might not always want to see, while `info` is for more general status updates.
* **Error Handling (Potential Enhancement):** While not explicitly added in this example, consider wrapping the `ac.get` call in a `try...except` block to log exceptions that might occur during the request:

```python
try:
    resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
    logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"An error occurred during the request: {e}", exc_info=True)  # Include traceback
    raise  # Re-raise the exception to fail the test
```

This would log the error message and the traceback, which is invaluable for debugging network issues.  `exc_info=True` is crucial for getting the traceback.

How to use the logging:

1.  **Configure Logging:**  Before running your tests, you need to configure the logging system. This is typically done in a `pytest.ini` file or in your test setup code.  A simple example for `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
log_cli = true
log_level = INFO  ; or DEBUG for more verbose output
log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s
log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
```

2.  **Run Tests:**  Run your tests using `pytest`. The log messages will be printed to the console (or written to a file, depending on your logging configuration).

This revised answer provides a functional and well-structured logging implementation that will significantly aid in debugging and understanding the behavior of your tests.  The addition of error handling would further enhance its robustness.
