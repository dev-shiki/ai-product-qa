**Explanation of the security improvement:**

**Vulnerability:**

The original code directly passes the user's `request.question` to the AI service (e.g., an LLM).  If the AI service isn't properly sandboxed or if the LLM is susceptible to prompt injection attacks, a malicious user could craft a question designed to extract sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, or manipulate the AI model's behavior.  This is especially dangerous if the AI service has access to internal systems or data.

**Improvement:**

The added line `request.question = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?!\.]', '', request.question)` performs input sanitization on the `request.question` before it's passed to the AI service.  Specifically:

*   `re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?!\.]', '', request.question)`: This regular expression removes any characters that are *not* alphanumeric (`\w`), whitespace (`\s`), question marks, exclamation points, or periods.

**Why this helps:**

*   **Reduces Attack Surface:** By removing potentially harmful characters, we significantly reduce the ability of an attacker to inject malicious commands or code into the AI service's input.  For example, characters like backticks (``), semicolons (;), dollar signs ($), and parentheses () are often used in command injection attacks. Removing them makes these types of attacks more difficult, though not necessarily impossible.
*   **Mitigates Prompt Injection (to some extent):** While a comprehensive prompt injection defense is complex and often requires model-specific techniques, sanitizing the input prevents simpler injection attempts that rely on special characters to break out of the intended context of the question.
*   **Defense in Depth:** This is a layer of defense.  Even if the AI service has its own input validation or security measures, adding sanitization at the API endpoint provides an extra level of protection.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This is not a silver bullet:**  Input sanitization is just one part of a comprehensive security strategy.  More sophisticated prompt injection attacks may still be possible, even with this sanitization in place.  You should also consider:
    *   **AI Service Security:** Implement robust security measures within the `AIService` itself, such as input validation, output filtering, and sandboxing.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Carefully design the prompts used to interact with the AI model to minimize the risk of injection attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the AI service generates any output that is displayed in a web browser, use CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review and test your security measures to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **False Positives:** Be careful not to be overly aggressive with your sanitization, as you could inadvertently block legitimate queries. The provided regex allows for common punctuation used in questions.
*   **Context Awareness:**  Ideally, the sanitization should be context-aware.  If you know that certain characters are valid in specific contexts (e.g., product names), you might want to allow them in those cases. However, implementing context-aware sanitization can be complex.

This suggestion provides a practical first step towards improving the security of the application.  However, remember that security is an ongoing process, and you should continue to evaluate and improve your security measures over time.
