# Logging Enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging to. I need the code of the function to be able to add appropriate logging statements.  For example, you can paste the function definition here.

Once you provide the function, I will:

1.  **Add `import logging` at the top.**
2.  **Configure a basic logger (if not already configured).**  I'll assume a basic configuration like `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` if no configuration exists in the provided code.  If you have a custom logging configuration, let me know.
3.  **Add logging statements at key points within the function:**
    *   **Function entry:**  Log the function's name and arguments.
    *   **Significant steps:** Log the values of important variables before and after they are modified.
    *   **Error handling:** Log exceptions when they occur.
    *   **Function exit:** Log the return value (if any).
    *   **Choose appropriate log levels:** Use `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` as appropriate.  I will use my best judgment to start, but you can always adjust these later.

**Example:**

If you give me this function:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  result = x + y
  return result
```

I would return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) # Or your preferred configuration

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Entering add function with x={x}, y={y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of addition: {result}")
  logging.info(f"Exiting add function, returning {result}")
  return result
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context:** If the function is part of a larger class or module, I will try to integrate the logging in a way that is consistent with the surrounding code.
*   **Verbosity:** I will try to strike a balance between providing enough information and not overwhelming the logs. You can always adjust the log levels and messages to suit your needs.
*   **Error Handling:**  If the function doesn't already have error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks), I won't add it.  However, I will log any exceptions that *do* occur within existing `except` blocks.

I look forward to helping you add logging to your function! Just paste the code of the function here.
