**Time**: 07:31:25  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the structure, I suggest two quick improvements:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Implement a configuration management system (e.g., using `configparser` or `pydantic`'s `BaseSettings`). Instead of hardcoding values across 21 files, centralize them for easier modification and deployment across different environments.

2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate CI using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI. This will automatically run your 8 tests on every commit, catching regressions early and ensuring code quality. This helps especially when there are a number of files to be kept up to date.
