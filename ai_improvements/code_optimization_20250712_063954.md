# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Improvement:** Pre-compile the regular expression (if it exists in the truncated code)

**Explanation:**  If the code uses `re.search` or `re.match` inside the `get_response` function (which is likely based on the category extraction logic), then pre-compiling the regular expression patterns outside the function, at the module level, will significantly improve performance, especially if `get_response` is called many times.  Regular expression compilation is relatively expensive. By doing it once at module load, you avoid the overhead on each call to `get_response`.

**Example (assuming a regex is used, replace with actual regex):**

```python
import logging
import re  # added import

# Pre-compile the regex pattern (replace with your actual pattern)
CATEGORY_REGEX = re.compile(r"(laptop|smartphone|tablet)", re.IGNORECASE)  # Moved outside the function

class AIService:
    # ... (rest of the class)

    async def get_response(self, question: str) -> str:
        # ... (rest of the function)

        # Use the pre-compiled regex
        match = CATEGORY_REGEX.search(question) # replace with actual usage of Regex
        if match:
           #...

        # ... (rest of the function)
```

If no regex is used, this optimization doesn't apply. Given the description of extracting categories, I assumed some sort of pattern matching.  If it's just `string in string` checks, then this doesn't apply. However, using the `category_mapping` dictionary and looking for keywords is already reasonably efficient, so a better optimization without seeing the full code is difficult to suggest.  The best improvement then becomes to *cache the results of API calls*.
