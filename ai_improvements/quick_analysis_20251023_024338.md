**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Structure & Modularity:** Given the `app/` directory structure and potentially growing number of files, consider further modularizing `app/api`.  Break down `queries.py` and `products.py` into smaller, more focused modules based on specific functionalities or data models. This enhances code readability, maintainability, and testability.

2. **Testing Coverage:** While 8 test files are present, evaluate their code coverage. Aim for high coverage, especially in crucial modules like `queries.py` and `products.py`, ensuring robust error handling and validated outputs for different input scenarios. Consider using a coverage tool to identify gaps.
