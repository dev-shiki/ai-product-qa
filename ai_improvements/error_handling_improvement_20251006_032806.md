Key improvements and explanations:

* **Specific Exception Handling:** Instead of a generic `except Exception`, the code now catches `TypeError` and `ValueError` specifically.  This allows for more targeted error handling and debugging.
* **Custom Exception:** A custom `ProcessingError` exception is defined.  This is crucial for cases where the generic `Exception` is caught, but you want to signal a problem specific to data processing within your service module.  This allows calling code to handle service-specific errors differently from other unexpected errors.  The `from e` clause preserves the original exception's traceback, which is vital for debugging.
* **`try...except` Blocks:** The `try...except` block is strategically placed around the code that is most likely to raise exceptions. This makes the error handling more focused.
* **Logging:** The `logger.error()` and `logger.exception()` calls log the errors to the console (or a file, depending on your logging configuration).  `logger.exception()` is used in the `except Exception` block to log the full stack trace, which is invaluable for diagnosing unexpected problems.  The stack trace shows the complete sequence of function calls that led to the error.  `logging.basicConfig` is added to enable basic logging.
* **Re-raising Exceptions:** In many cases, the best approach is to catch the exception, log it, and then *re-raise* the exception. This allows the calling code to handle the error appropriately (e.g., retry the operation, display an error message to the user, etc.).  If you *don't* re-raise, the calling code might not be aware that an error occurred.  The `raise` statement without arguments re-raises the currently active exception.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The exception messages provide clear information about what went wrong.
* **Input Validation:**  The code checks that the input `data` is a dictionary and that it contains the 'value' key.  It also checks that the 'value' is a number (either an integer or a float). This prevents errors from propagating deeper into the code.
* **Example Usage:** The `main()` function provides an example of how to call `process_data()` and handle potential exceptions.  This demonstrates how the error handling in the service module integrates with the calling code.
* **Clearer Comments:** Improved comments explain the purpose of each section of the code and the reasoning behind the error handling strategy.

How to use it and Adapt it:

1. **Replace `process_data` with your function:** Substitute the `process_data` function with the actual function in your service module that needs improved error handling.
2. **Adjust Exception Types:** Modify the `except` blocks to catch the specific exceptions that your function might raise.  Use custom exceptions (like `ProcessingError`) to represent errors specific to your service.
3. **Customize Logging:** Configure the logging level (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`, `logging.WARNING`, `logging.ERROR`) to control the amount of information that is logged.  You can also configure the logger to write to a file instead of the console.
4. **Modify the Re-raising Behavior:** Decide whether to re-raise exceptions in each `except` block.  If you don't re-raise, the calling code will not be aware that an error occurred.  Consider logging the error even if you don't re-raise it.
5. **Add Input Validation:** Validate the input data to your function to prevent errors from occurring in the first place.
6. **Handle Custom Exceptions in Calling Code:**  The calling code (e.g., the `main` function in the example) should handle the custom exceptions that your service module raises.

This improved error handling makes your service module more robust and easier to debug. It also allows calling code to handle errors gracefully.
