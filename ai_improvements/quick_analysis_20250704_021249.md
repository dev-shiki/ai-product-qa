**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Centralize Configuration:** With 21 Python files, you likely have configuration scattered around.  Introduce a dedicated configuration file (e.g., using a `config.py` or `settings.py`) to manage environment variables, API keys, database settings, etc. This promotes maintainability and avoids hardcoding.

2.  **Improve Testing Structure:**  While 8 test files are good, assess their coverage and organization. Consider using pytest's conftest.py for shared fixtures and helper functions.  Aim for clear test naming conventions and ensure each test file focuses on a specific module or functionality.
