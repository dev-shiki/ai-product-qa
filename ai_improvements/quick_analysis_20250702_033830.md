## Quick Insights

Given the structure, I suggest these quick improvements:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:** Implement a consistent code style using tools like Black and Flake8.  Automate this process with pre-commit hooks to catch style issues before they're committed. This boosts readability and collaboration.

2.  **Improve Test Structure & Coverage:**  Ensure your 8 test files have good coverage. Consider using a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage.  Organize tests to mirror your application structure for maintainability.  Write unit tests for individual modules and integration tests to ensure your APIs work together correctly.
