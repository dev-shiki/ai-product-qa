## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Improve modularity and organization:** Consider grouping related Python files into more specific subdirectories within `./app`. For example, separate concerns like API routes, database interactions, and utility functions.

2.  **Implement code linting and formatting:** Integrate tools like `flake8` or `pylint` for code quality and `black` for consistent formatting. This will improve readability and maintainability across the 21 Python files, especially during collaborative development. Add these tools to your CI/CD pipeline if applicable.
