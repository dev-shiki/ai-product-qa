## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Improve code organization:** Given the structure (`./app/main.py`, `./app/api/...`), consider formalizing `app` as a proper Python package with an `__init__.py` file. This clarifies module imports and promotes better code organization. Consider using sub-packages within `api` for further structuring, such as separating product queries from other API logic.

2.  **Enhance testing:** Aim for higher test coverage than 8 test files covering 21 code files suggests. Prioritize unit tests for core logic in modules like `queries.py` and `products.py`. Consider using a coverage tool to identify gaps.
