## Improvement

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

def test_product_specifications():
    try:
        spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
        assert spec.rating == 4.5
        assert spec.sold == 100
        assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
        assert spec.color == "Hitam"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion Error in test_product_specifications: {e}")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in test_product_specifications: {e}")
        raise

def test_product():
    try:
        spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
        product = Product(
            id="1",
            name="Produk A",
            category="Elektronik",
            brand="BrandX",
            price=1000000,
            currency="IDR",
            description="Deskripsi produk",
            specifications=spec,
            images=["img1.jpg"],
            url="http://produk.com/1"
        )
        assert product.id == "1"
        assert product.specifications.rating == 5
        assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion Error in test_product: {e}")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in test_product: {e}")
        raise

def test_product_response():
    try:
        resp = ProductResponse(
            id="1",
            name="Produk A",
            category="Elektronik",
            brand="BrandX",
            price=1000000,
            description="Deskripsi produk",
            specifications={"rating": 5},
            images=["img1.jpg"],
            url="http://produk.com/1"
        )
        assert resp.id == "1"
        assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Assertion Error in test_product_response: {e}")
        raise
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"KeyError in test_product_response: {e}.  Check if the 'rating' key exists in specifications.")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error in test_product_response: {e}")
        raise
```

Key improvements:

* **`try...except` blocks around each test:** This is the core improvement.  It allows us to catch exceptions that might occur during the test execution.  This prevents a single failing test from halting the entire test suite.
* **Specific Exception Handling:**  I've caught `AssertionError` specifically, which is crucial.  This indicates that an `assert` statement failed, meaning the test did not meet the expected condition.  I've also added a `KeyError` catch in `test_product_response` which is likely to occur if the `specifications` dictionary does not contain the 'rating' key.
* **Informative Error Messages:**  The `print` statements provide much more context when an error occurs. They tell you:
    * Which test failed.
    * The specific type of error (e.g., `AssertionError`, `KeyError`, `Exception`).
    * The error message associated with the exception (e.g., `e`).
* **`raise` after printing:** This is VERY important. After printing the error message, the `raise` statement re-raises the exception. This ensures that the test still fails (as it should), but the failure is now properly reported by the testing framework.  If you omit `raise`, the test will appear to PASS even though an error occurred, which is highly misleading. This allows the testing framework to properly report the failure.
* **General `Exception` Catch:**  The `except Exception as e` clause is a catch-all for any other unexpected errors that might arise during the test execution. This ensures that even if an unforeseen error occurs, it will be caught and reported, preventing the test suite from crashing silently.

This revised code provides robust error handling that makes your tests much more reliable and easier to debug.  It provides context when tests fail and prevents failures from being missed.
