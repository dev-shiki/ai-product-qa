**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Implement a clear project structure and dependency management.** With 21 Python files, ensure a modular structure (e.g., using `__init__.py` files in directories) and utilize a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to explicitly define project dependencies for reproducibility and easier collaboration.

2. **Improve testing practices.** 8 test files are good, but focus on test coverage and potentially integrate a CI/CD pipeline. Check your test coverage using a tool like `coverage.py`. Automate running tests upon code changes to prevent regressions and maintain code quality.
