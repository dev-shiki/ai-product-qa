**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Okay, here are two quick improvement suggestions based on the provided information:

1.  **Implement Linting/Formatting:** With 21 Python files, inconsistencies in code style are likely. Introduce a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a formatter (like Black) to automatically enforce coding standards.  This improves readability, reduces code review burden, and prevents common errors.

2.  **Analyze Test Coverage:**  Having 8 test files is good, but what's the coverage? Use a tool like `coverage.py` to determine how much of your codebase is actually exercised by your tests.  Low coverage means potential bugs are lurking. Aim for a reasonably high percentage (e.g., 80%+) and focus on testing critical paths.
