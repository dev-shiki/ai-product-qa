## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider a linter and formatter:** Integrate a linter (like Flake8 or pylint) and formatter (like Black) into your workflow. This enforces consistent coding style across all 21 files, improving readability and maintainability. You can configure these tools with pre-commit hooks for automatic checks.

2.  **Review test coverage:** With only 8 test files supporting 21 source files, analyze your test coverage. Aim for a higher percentage, focusing on critical modules and edge cases. Tools like `coverage.py` can help identify untested code.
