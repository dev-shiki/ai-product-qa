## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:** Implement a consistent code style across all files using a linter (like Flake8) and a formatter (like Black).  This enhances readability and reduces merge conflicts. Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check and enforce style rules.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage beyond just 8 test files. Use coverage tools to identify gaps in testing and prioritize testing critical and complex functions. Consider expanding test suite with edge case scenarios and integration tests.
