## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    # Retrieve version from environment variable or default to a safe value
    version = os.getenv("API_VERSION", "1.0.0") 
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == version
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is to retrieve the API version from an environment variable rather than hardcoding it in the test.

**Why is this more secure?**

*   **Configuration Management and Secrets Handling:** Hardcoding the version directly in the test code means any change to the version requires modifying the test file itself.  This is problematic if the version is sensitive or should be managed separately from the code. By using an environment variable, the version can be updated without touching the codebase, improving configuration management and security.  Environment variables are frequently used to store sensitive information or configuration that shouldn't be part of the application's source code (e.g., API keys, database passwords, etc.). This also makes it easier to deploy different versions of the API with different versions reported by the /health endpoint, without needing to change the test code.

*   **Prevents Accidental Leaks:**  If the version number contains any information that you don't want to be publicly available, using an environment variable isolates it better than hardcoding.

**How the code works:**

1.  **`import os`:** Imports the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, including accessing environment variables.

2.  **`version = os.getenv("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")`:**  This line retrieves the value of the environment variable named "API\_VERSION".
    *   `os.getenv("API_VERSION")` attempts to read the value of the environment variable "API\_VERSION".
    *   `"1.0.0"`:  If the environment variable "API\_VERSION" is *not* set, the `getenv` function returns the default value "1.0.0".  This provides a safe fallback and ensures the test still functions if the environment variable is missing.  You can set the environment variable when running the tests.  For example, on Linux/macOS:

    ```bash
    API_VERSION=2.0.0 pytest
    ```

    Or on Windows:

    ```powershell
    $env:API_VERSION="2.0.0"
    pytest
    ```

3. **Use version variable in the assertion**: The `version` variable is then used in the assertion to verify that the /health endpoint returns the correct version, as retrieved from the environment.

This approach provides a more secure and manageable way to handle the API version within the tests.
