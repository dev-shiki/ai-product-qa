**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Based on the file structure, it appears the project has good test coverage. Two potential improvements:

1. **Consider a linting/formatting tool:** With 21 files, enforcing consistent code style is important. Employing a tool like `flake8` or `black` can automate style checks and formatting, reducing code review burden and improving readability.

2. **Evaluate test structure for maintainability:** 8 test files may grow. Consider using subdirectories to group tests logically (e.g., `tests/ai_service/`, `tests/products/`) as the project expands. This enhances test organization and simplifies navigation.
