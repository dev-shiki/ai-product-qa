## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Code Style Consistency:** Enforce consistent code style using a tool like `Black` and `flake8`. Automate this within a pre-commit hook to ensure all code adheres to the defined style before committing. This increases readability and maintainability.

2.  **Testing Coverage:** With 8 test files against 21 Python files, assess test coverage. Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to identify untested code paths and prioritize writing tests to improve robustness. Aim for a target coverage percentage (e.g., 80%+) to ensure critical functions are thoroughly tested.
