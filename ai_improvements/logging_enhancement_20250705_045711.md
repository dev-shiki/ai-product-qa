## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (example configuration)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    logging.info(f"get_products called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")  # Log entry

    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        logging.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.") # Log success
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in get_products: {str(e)}", exc_info=True) # Log error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  The `logging` module is essential for using logging features.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(...)` sets up basic logging to the console.  This is crucial; without it, the logging statements won't output anything.  Important arguments:
    * `level=logging.INFO`:  Sets the logging level to INFO.  This means log messages with level INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL will be displayed.  You can change this to `logging.DEBUG` to see more detailed logs.
    * `format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'`: Defines the format of the log messages (timestamp, log level, message).  Adjust this to your preference.
* **Log Entry at the Start:** `logging.info(f"get_products called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")` logs the function call, including the values of the parameters. This is extremely valuable for debugging, as it tells you *exactly* what the function was called with.
* **Log Success:** `logging.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")` logs when the product retrieval is successful, reporting the number of products retrieved.
* **Log Error with Exception Details:**  `logging.error(f"Error in get_products: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)` logs any exceptions that occur *within* the `try` block.  Critically, `exc_info=True` includes the full traceback in the log message, which is vital for diagnosing the cause of the error.  Simply logging `str(e)` only provides the error message, which is often insufficient.
* **Concise and informative messages:** The log messages are designed to be clear and helpful for debugging.

This revised solution addresses all the points from the previous responses and includes a full and complete example of how to add logging to a function.  It is ready to be copied and pasted into your code. Remember to adapt the `logging.basicConfig` to suit your project's needs (e.g., logging to a file instead of the console).
