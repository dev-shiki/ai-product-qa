## Improvement

**Optimization:** Use `__slots__` for classes that have a fixed set of attributes.

**Explanation:**

If the utility modules define classes that represent data structures with a known, fixed set of attributes, using `__slots__` can significantly reduce memory usage and improve attribute access speed.  By default, Python uses a `__dict__` attribute for each object to store its attributes, which is a dynamically sized dictionary. `__slots__` replaces the `__dict__` with a static allocation, avoiding the dictionary overhead.  This is particularly helpful when creating a large number of instances of these classes, as it can save a substantial amount of memory.

**Example (assuming a class `Point` is defined in the utility module):**

```python
class Point:
    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
```

By adding `__slots__ = ('x', 'y')` to the `Point` class, we inform Python that instances of `Point` will only have `x` and `y` attributes, allowing it to store these attributes more efficiently.
