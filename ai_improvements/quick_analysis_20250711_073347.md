# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 07:33:47  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Enforce Consistent Style:** With 21 files, use a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black`. This ensures consistent code style across the project, improving readability and maintainability. Configure a pre-commit hook to automate this process and prevent poorly formatted code from being committed.

2.  **Improve Test Discovery:** Consider using a more explicit testing structure, perhaps organizing tests into modules mirroring the `app` structure (e.g., `tests/test_api_products.py`). This can improve test discoverability and maintainability, especially as the project grows.
