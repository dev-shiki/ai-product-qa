## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

# Configure logging (optional, but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.queries.product_service")
async def test_get_brands(mock_service):
    """Tests the get_brands endpoint."""
    logger.info("Starting test_get_brands")
    mock_service.get_brands.return_value = ["Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"]
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/queries/brands")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
        logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")
    assert "brands" in data
    assert set(data["brands"]) >= {"Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"}
    logger.info("test_get_brands finished successfully")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Logging Setup:**  The code now includes `import logging` and sets up basic logging with `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`.  This is crucial. Without configuring the logger, you won't see any output.  `logging.INFO` means you'll see informational messages and higher severity levels (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).  You can adjust the level for more or less detail.  We also create a logger specific to this module `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. This is best practice for organizing logs, especially in larger projects.

* **Clear Log Messages:** The log messages are now much more informative:
    * `logger.info("Starting test_get_brands")`: Marks the beginning of the test.
    * `logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/queries/brands")`: Indicates the HTTP request being sent.
    * `logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")`: Logs the HTTP status code.  The `f` prefix is essential for formatting the string to include the variable's value.
    * `logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")`: Logs the actual response data (using `debug` level as it might be verbose).
    * `logger.info("test_get_brands finished successfully")`:  Confirms a successful test run.

* **Debug Level:** The `logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")` line uses the `debug` logging level. This is important because you likely *don't* want to see the full JSON response in normal operation, only when you're actively debugging.  Change `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` to `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` temporarily if you want to see the debug-level logs.

* **String Formatting:** Uses f-strings (e.g., `f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}"`) for clear and efficient string formatting. This is the modern and preferred way to include variable values in log messages.

* **Context:**  The logging adds context to what's happening in the test.  You can now easily track the flow, see the requests and responses, and diagnose failures more quickly.

How to run and see the logs:

1. **Make sure you have `pytest` and `httpx` installed:**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest httpx
   ```

2. **Save the code:** Save the complete code (including the logging and the other test functions) into a file, for example, `test_queries.py`.  Crucially, make sure the `app.main` module actually exists and is importable.  The tests rely on importing `app.main`.

3. **Run pytest with logging enabled:**
   ```bash
   pytest -s test_queries.py -v
   ```

   * `-s` is *essential* to capture the stdout/stderr output where the logs are being written. Without `-s`, pytest often hides the output.
   * `-v` (verbose) is optional but can provide more information about the test run.

4. **Change the logging level to DEBUG:** If you want to see the `logger.debug` messages, modify the `logging.basicConfig` line to `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` before running pytest again.

This revised answer provides a complete, runnable solution with robust logging that will greatly assist in debugging your tests.  Remember to adapt the log messages to fit the specific logic and data within your tests.
