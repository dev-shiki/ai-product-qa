## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    with mock.patch.dict(os.environ, {"API_PORT": "8000"}): # Set API_PORT if its missing.
        s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
        assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
        assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")

```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The primary security concern here is the reliance on environment variables without ensuring their presence.  If `API_PORT` is not set in the environment when the `Settings` class is initialized in `test_settings_valid`, the test might fail or, in a real application, cause unexpected behavior or potentially expose default values that are not secure.  While the test currently passes because `config.Settings` likely has a default value for `API_PORT`, it's better to be explicit and control the test environment completely.

The added code uses `mock.patch.dict` to ensure the `API_PORT` environment variable is set to "8000" *within the scope of the test*.  This makes the test more robust and less reliant on the global environment.  If the application code were to, for example, rely on the presence of `API_PORT` for a critical security function, this test would now more accurately simulate that scenario and prevent unintended consequences if the variable is missing in a real-world deployment.  If `API_PORT` is set externally, then this patch would overwrite it for the duration of the test, and then revert the original value.

Why not use `monkeypatch`? `monkeypatch` is fine, but `mock.patch.dict` is often preferred when dealing with environment variables within a specific test context because it's more explicit and less prone to affecting other parts of the test suite inadvertently. It isolates the change to the environment variable to only the code inside the `with` block.
