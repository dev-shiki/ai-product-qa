# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_ai_service.py`  
**Time**: 02:57:19  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_error():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_generate.side_effect = Exception("API Error")
        logger.error("Simulating API Error in test_get_response_with_error")
        
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        assert "Maaf, saya sedang mengalami kesulitan" in response
        logger.info(f"Response received: {response}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  This line imports the `logging` module, which is essential for using logging functionality.
* **`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`:** This creates a logger instance specifically for this test module. Using `__name__` ensures that log messages are associated with the correct module, making debugging easier. This is a *critical* best practice.
* **`logger.error("Simulating API Error in test_get_response_with_error")`:**  This logs an error message *before* the `get_response` function is called when an error is expected. This is valuable because you can see in the logs that the test *intended* to trigger an error.  This helps differentiate intentional errors from unexpected ones.   Critically, I'm using `logger.error` because the test *simulates an error*.  Use `logger.info` for routine events and `logger.debug` for detailed troubleshooting information.
* **`logger.info(f"Response received: {response}")`:** This logs the actual response received *after* calling the `get_response` function.  This allows you to confirm what was returned in the face of the simulated API error. Using an f-string ensures the variable is logged correctly.
* **Placement of logging statements:** The logging statements are strategically placed *around* the call to `get_response`.  This gives you a complete picture of what happened during the test.  Log before the call to show the intent, and after to show the result.

How to use the logging:

1.  **Configure Logging:** You need to configure the logging level and output in your `pytest.ini` file or in your test setup.  A basic example `pytest.ini`:

    ```ini
    [pytest]
    log_cli = true
    log_level = INFO  ; Or DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s
    log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
    ```

2.  **Run Pytest:** When you run `pytest`, the log messages will be displayed in your console output. If you're using an IDE, it may have its own way to display logs.

This revised solution provides a more robust and informative logging setup for your test function.  It's now much easier to diagnose issues that might arise during testing.  The key is to strategically place the logging statements to give a full picture of the process.  Remember to configure your `pytest.ini`!
