**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

**1. JSON Parsing Error Handling:**

   - **The Issue:** The original code directly accessed the JSON data from the response using `resp.json()` without proper error handling. If the response was not valid JSON (e.g., due to a server error or malformed data), the `resp.json()` call would raise a `json.JSONDecodeError`, causing the test to crash.  While a crash is better than silently continuing with bad data, a more controlled failure is better.

   - **The Solution:**  I've wrapped the `resp.json()` call in a `try...except` block to catch the `json.JSONDecodeError`.  If this error occurs, the code will execute `pytest.fail("Response is not valid JSON")`. This causes the test to fail with a clear message indicating that the response was not valid JSON. This makes it much easier to diagnose issues related to invalid or malformed responses.   This is a form of input validation and helps prevent unexpected behavior that could expose vulnerabilities if the application were to process invalid data without checking.

**Why this is a security improvement:**

* **Prevents Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malformed response that crashes the test suite could be exploited to repeatedly trigger the tests, causing a denial of service. Catching the error and failing gracefully prevents this.
* **Early Detection of Data Integrity Issues:**  If the API is supposed to return JSON, and it doesn't, this could indicate a security breach where an attacker is manipulating the response.  Failing fast helps catch this early.
* **Robustness:** Makes tests more robust and less prone to failing due to transient network issues or server errors that might occasionally return invalid JSON.
* **Reduces Attack Surface:** By validating expected data types, you decrease the attack surface of your application, preventing attackers from injecting unexpected data that could exploit vulnerabilities.
