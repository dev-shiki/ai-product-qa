# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_config.py`  
**Time**: 03:30:51  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock
import logging

# Configure logging (basic configuration for demonstration)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    """
    Tests that the Settings class raises a ValueError when the Google API key is invalid.
    """
    logging.info("Starting test_settings_invalid")
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        logging.info("Attempting to initialize Settings with invalid API key.")
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
        logging.error("ValueError was NOT raised when it was expected.") # This line should not be reached if the test works correctly
    logging.info("Finished test_settings_invalid")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Logging Messages:**  The logging messages now clearly indicate what's happening at each step (entering the test, setting the environment variable, attempting to initialize `Settings`, what we expect to happen (ValueError), and exiting the test). This makes it much easier to understand the test's flow when looking at the logs.  I also added an error message if the `ValueError` isn't raised as expected, which will help debug the test if it fails.
* **`logging.info` and `logging.error`:** Uses `logging.info` for general information and `logging.error` if something unexpected happens (like the `ValueError` not being raised).  This uses more appropriate logging levels.
* **Handles Expected Exception:** The `with pytest.raises(ValueError)` context manager is *crucial*.  It allows the test to pass *if* the ValueError is raised, and it fails the test if the ValueError isn't raised. The original code without the with statement would just crash if `Settings` raised the exception, and you wouldn't get a clear test failure.  The logging inside confirms whether the exception was raised as expected.
* **Avoids Premature Imports:** The logging configuration is done *outside* the function to avoid unnecessary setup per test execution.
* **Conciseness:** The code is well-formatted and easy to read, keeping the focus on the logging additions.
* **Complete Example (including import):**  The logging statement imports the `logging` library.  Important: to make this runnable, you'd need to have a placeholder `app.utils.config` module that at least defines a `Settings` class which can raise a ValueError.

How to Run with Logging:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_config.py`).  Make sure you have a `app/utils/config.py` file (even if it's a stub).
2.  **Run pytest:**  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run `pytest test_config.py -s`.  The `-s` flag is important; it tells pytest *not* to capture stdout/stderr, which is where the logging output goes.  Without `-s`, you won't see the log messages.

Example `app/utils/config.py` stub:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, GOOGLE_API_KEY):
        self.GOOGLE_API_KEY = GOOGLE_API_KEY
        self.API_PORT = 8000
        if GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            raise ValueError("Invalid Google API Key")
```

Now you'll see the logging output in your console when you run the tests, giving you much better insight into what the test is doing.  Critically, you'll see if the `ValueError` is raised as expected.
