1.  **Improve project structure & discoverability:** Create a clear, top-level `README.md` explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples. This dramatically improves onboarding for new developers and simplifies contribution.

2.  **Leverage linting & formatting:** Implement a tool like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all `.py` files. This reduces stylistic debates during code reviews and improves overall readability, especially important with 21 Python files to maintain.
