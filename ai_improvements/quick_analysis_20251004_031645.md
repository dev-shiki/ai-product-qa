**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Improve modularity and separation of concerns:** With 21 Python files, especially within an "app" structure, ensure clear separation of concerns. Analyze `./app/main.py`, `./app/api/queries.py`, and `./app/api/products.py` for tightly coupled logic. Refactor to isolate business logic, data access, and API endpoints for better maintainability and testability.

2.  **Assess test coverage:** While you have 8 test files, evaluate the actual code coverage provided. Use a coverage tool (e.g., `pytest-cov`) to identify untested areas. Prioritize testing critical functionalities, especially around the API endpoints. Ensure tests cover different input scenarios and edge cases.
