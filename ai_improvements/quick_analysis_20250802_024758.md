## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Increase test coverage:** With 8 test files and 21 source files, the test coverage likely needs improvement.  Prioritize writing tests focusing on critical functionality and complex logic, especially in the `models` directory.  Aim for a higher ratio of tests to source files.

2.  **Enforce code style:** Consider using a linter like `flake8` or `pylint`, and a formatter like `black` to ensure consistent code style across all files.  This improves readability and maintainability.  Add pre-commit hooks to automatically check style before committing.
