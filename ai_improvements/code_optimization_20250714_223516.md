# Code Optimization

**File**: `./app/services/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 22:35:16  
**Type**: code_optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization Suggestion:**

Add docstrings to the module and any functions within it to document the purpose and functionality of the code.

**Explanation:**

While this doesn't directly improve *runtime performance*, it improves code maintainability and readability, which is a crucial aspect of optimization in the broader sense.  Clear documentation helps developers (including yourself in the future) understand the code quickly, debug it efficiently, and avoid introducing errors during modifications.  It falls under the category of "optimization for maintainability".
