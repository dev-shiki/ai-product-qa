# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:50:21  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the size (21 files, 8 tests), focus on structure and testing.

1. **Package Structure & Imports:**  Ensure clear module organization within `app`.  Explicit relative imports (e.g., `from . import products` in `queries.py`) improve readability and prevent naming conflicts, especially as the project grows.

2. **Test Coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage than simply "8 test files." Use a coverage tool (e.g., `pytest-cov`) to identify untested areas. Prioritize testing API endpoints and critical business logic within `queries.py` and `products.py`.
