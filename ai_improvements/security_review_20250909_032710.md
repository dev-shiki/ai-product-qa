**Security Improvement:**

**Input Sanitization/Validation (Prevention of Injection attacks):**

While not directly present in the provided test code, a *crucial* improvement would be to ensure that the `app.api.products.product_service.get_products` function *itself* properly sanitizes and validates any input it receives, *especially* when those inputs come from external sources like the query parameters in the URL.  For example:

```python
# Inside product_service.py (example)

def get_products(category: str = None):
    if category:
        # VALIDATE THE CATEGORY!  Prevent SQL injection or other issues.
        if not is_safe_category(category):  # Implement is_safe_category
            raise ValueError("Invalid category") # Or return an error.

        # ... your database query here, using parameters to prevent SQL injection
        # Example (using an ORM like SQLAlchemy)
        products = Product.query.filter(Product.category == category).all() # parameterized query.
    else:
        products = Product.query.all()

    return products

def is_safe_category(category):
    # VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE - improve as needed
    allowed_categories = ["smartphone", "laptop", "tablet"]
    return category in allowed_categories
```

**Explanation:**

1. **The Vulnerability:**  If the `get_products` function in `app.api.products.product_service` takes the `category` parameter directly from the URL (e.g., `request.args.get("category")`) and uses it in a database query *without sanitization*, the application becomes vulnerable to SQL injection or other injection-based attacks.  An attacker could craft a malicious `category` value that, when passed to the database, could allow them to read, modify, or even delete data.

2. **The Solution (Input Validation/Sanitization):**
   - **Validation:**  Before using the `category` parameter, validate that it conforms to an expected format or belongs to an allowed set of values.  For example, you might check that the category is one of a few predefined categories (e.g., "smartphone", "laptop", "tablet").
   - **Parameterized Queries:**  Crucially, when constructing database queries, *always* use parameterized queries (or prepared statements) if your database library supports them.  Parameterized queries ensure that user-provided input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command, thus preventing SQL injection.  ORMs (like SQLAlchemy in Python) usually provide mechanisms for this.
   - **Encoding/Escaping:**  Depending on the context, you might need to encode or escape user-provided input to prevent it from being interpreted as special characters or commands by the database or other systems.

**Why this is important:**

The provided test code currently mocks the `product_service`, so it *doesn't* directly exercise the vulnerable code.  However, in a real application, this vulnerability would be exploitable. By adding input sanitization and parameterized queries within the `product_service` function, you can significantly reduce the risk of injection attacks.  This should be considered a fundamental security best practice whenever handling user-supplied input.
