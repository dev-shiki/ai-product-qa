## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
import logging

# Configure logging (consider placing this in a separate configuration file)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)  # Set the desired logging level

@pytest.fixture
def mock_local_service():
    return MagicMock()

@pytest.fixture
def product_service(mock_local_service):
    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

class TestProductDataService:
    
    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_success(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test successful product search"""
        mock_products = [
            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", 5)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        try:
            result = await product_service.search_products("test", 5)
            assert result == []
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Search products failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
            pytest.fail(f"Search products failed: {e}") # Fail the test explicitly
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test get_products with search parameter"""
        mock_products = [{"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max"}]
... (truncated for analysis)
```

Key improvements:

* **Explicit Exception Handling with `try...except`:** The `test_search_products_error` now uses a `try...except` block to specifically catch exceptions raised by the `search_products` method.  This is crucial for proper error handling.

* **Logging:**  The `logging.error` call logs the exception details (including the traceback) to the console or a log file.  This makes debugging significantly easier. The `exc_info=True` argument ensures that the full traceback is included in the log message.  Consider moving the logging configuration to a separate configuration file for better maintainability.

* **Test Failure:** `pytest.fail(f"Search products failed: {e}")` is used to explicitly fail the test when an exception is caught. This is important because simply catching the exception and asserting that the result is an empty list might mask unexpected errors.  Without `pytest.fail`, the test might pass even if the `search_products` method fails in an unexpected way.

* **Clarity:** By catching the exception, logging it, and then explicitly failing the test, you gain much better visibility into what went wrong during the test.

* **Robustness:** This approach is more robust because it handles *any* exception that might be raised by the mocked `search_products` method, rather than just assuming that it will always return an empty list on error.

This revised code provides much better error handling and reporting in the error test case, making the test suite more reliable and easier to debug.
