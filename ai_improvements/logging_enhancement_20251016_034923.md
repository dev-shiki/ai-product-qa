# Logging Enhancement

**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import logging
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (basic configuration)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    logger.info(f"get_products called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Error in get_products: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:** The `logging` module is crucial for adding log statements.
* **Configure Logging (Basic):**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up basic logging to the console.  `level=logging.INFO` means log messages with severity `INFO` or higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be displayed.  This is *essential* to see the logs.  Without this, the `logger.info`, `logger.exception` etc. calls won't produce any output.  A more sophisticated logging configuration (file output, different formats) would be used in a production environment, but this provides a functional base.
* **Create a Logger Instance:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger specific to this module.  Using `__name__` is best practice as it clearly identifies where the log messages are coming from.
* **Log at Entry:** `logger.info(f"get_products called with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")` logs the function call and its parameters. This is invaluable for debugging.  F-strings are used for efficient string formatting.
* **Log on Success:** `logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")` logs the successful retrieval of products, including the number of products returned.  This confirms the function completed successfully.
* **Log Exceptions:**  `logger.exception(f"Error in get_products: {e}")` logs the exception *and* the traceback. `logger.exception` is critically important: it automatically includes the full stack trace, which is vital for diagnosing the root cause of an error.  It's far more useful than just logging the exception message itself.  The traceback shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error.
* **Clear and Informative Messages:** The log messages are designed to be clear and helpful, providing context about what the function is doing and any potential problems.  Using f-strings makes them easy to read.
* **Placement:** The logging statements are placed strategically:
    * **Beginning:** Logs the start of the function's execution and the input parameters.
    * **Success:** Logs when the products are retrieved successfully.
    * **Exception Handling:** Logs the exception, including the traceback if an error occurs.
* **No unnecessary logging**:  Avoided logging every single variable value inside the `try` block unless absolutely necessary, to keep logs clean and focused.  The exception logging will capture the error and associated context.

This revised response provides a complete and functional solution for adding effective logging to the `get_products` function.  It follows best practices for logging in Python and will greatly aid in debugging and monitoring your application.  Remember to configure your logging appropriately for your environment (e.g., writing to a file instead of the console in production).
