## Quick Insights

Given the small project size, focus on maintainability and test coverage.

1.  **Enforce a consistent style:**  Introduce a linter like Flake8 or Pylint and a formatter like Black to ensure consistent code style across all 21 Python files.  This improves readability and reduces merge conflicts.

2.  **Measure test coverage:** Implement a coverage tool like `coverage.py` and aim for above 80% coverage. Analyzing coverage reports will help identify untested code areas, particularly in the 21 non-test files, and improve the reliability of the project.
