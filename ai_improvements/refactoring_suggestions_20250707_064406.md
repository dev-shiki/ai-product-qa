## Improvement

```python
"""
Defines the data structures used throughout the application.
"""
```

**Explanation:**

The original docstring "Data models for the application" is very generic.  The refactored docstring "Defines the data structures used throughout the application" is slightly more specific and informative.  It clarifies that the module contains definitions of data structures and their purpose within the application, giving a better understanding of the module's contents at a glance. This adheres to best practices for documentation, improving code maintainability and readability.
