# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Improvement:**  Remove redundant `ProductSpecifications` instantiation in `test_product()`.

**Explanation:**

The `ProductSpecifications` object `spec` in `test_product()` is only used to set the `rating`.  It's less verbose and slightly more efficient to directly create the `Product` object with the `specifications` as a dictionary.  This avoids the overhead of creating an unnecessary object.

**Revised `test_product()`:**

```python
def test_product():
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5}, # Directly pass a dictionary
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications["rating"] == 5 # Access like a dictionary
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]
```

**Note:** This assumes the `Product` class can accept a dictionary for `specifications` (as is consistent with `ProductResponse`).  If it *requires* a `ProductSpecifications` object, then this optimization is not applicable. However, even in that case, you could create one `ProductSpecifications` object once at the module level and reuse it, as long as modifying its attributes doesn't affect other tests. But the most direct improvement is as shown, provided the `Product` class design permits.

**Why this is an optimization:**

*   **Reduced Object Creation:**  Eliminates the unnecessary creation of a `ProductSpecifications` object.
*   **Simplification:** Makes the code slightly more concise and easier to read, assuming the data model allows a dictionary for specifications.
