# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:02:43  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Introduce a linter and formatter (e.g., Flake8, Black):**  With 21 files, consistent code style becomes crucial. Automated linting and formatting will enforce standards, improve readability, and reduce potential errors across the codebase.

2.  **Improve test structure and consider coverage:** 8 test files alongside 21 code files suggests a possible imbalance. Analyze test coverage (using `coverage.py`) to identify untested areas. Improve test organization, perhaps by grouping tests based on functionality or module, to make them easier to maintain and understand.
