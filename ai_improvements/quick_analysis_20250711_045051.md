## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Improve Code Structure:** Consider structuring your main application logic (`app/main.py`) into smaller, well-defined modules.  This could involve creating separate modules for configuration, startup tasks, and core application flow, improving readability and maintainability.

2.  **Prioritize Unit Testing:**  With 8 test files against 21 Python files, review test coverage.  Ensure tests cover critical functions, especially in your API modules like `app/api/products.py`. Aim for higher test coverage to catch potential bugs early.
