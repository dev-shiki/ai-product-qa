```python

    "my_app": hashlib.sha256("secret_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()  # Use hashlib
}

**Security Improvement: API Key Authentication (with Hashing)**

The core security improvement is the implementation of API Key authentication using hashing.  Here's a breakdown of the changes and why they are important:

1. **`require_api_key` Decorator:**
   - This decorator acts as middleware, protecting routes by requiring a valid API key in the request headers.
   - `@wraps(f)`:  This preserves the original function's metadata (name, docstring, etc.), which is important for debugging and introspection.

2. **API Key Storage (with Hashing):**
   - **`API_KEYS` Dictionary:** This dictionary (in a real application, this should be in a database or secure configuration) stores API keys associated with different applications or users.
   - **`hashlib.sha256("secret_api_key".encode()).hexdigest()`:  Crucially, the API keys are *hashed* before being stored.**  Hashing is a one-way function.  It's extremely difficult (practically impossible) to recover the original API key from its hash.  If an attacker gains access to the stored hashes, they *cannot* directly retrieve the API keys.
   -  **Important Note:**  Storing API keys directly in code (even with hashing) is **not** best practice for production.  Use environment variables, secure configuration files (e.g., using libraries like `python-dotenv` or `configparser`), or a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) to store sensitive information.

3. **API Key Verification (with Hashing):**
   - `api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")`: The decorator retrieves the API key from the `X-API-Key` header in the request.
   - `hashed_api_key = hashlib.sha256(api_key.encode()).hexdigest()`:  The *received* API key from the request is also hashed using the *same* hashing algorithm (SHA256).
   - `if hashed_api_key not in API_KEYS.values():`:  The hashed API key from the request is compared against the *hashed* API keys stored in the `API_KEYS` dictionary.  This is the critical step that ensures the API key is valid without ever storing or comparing the actual plaintext API key.
   - If the hashed key matches one of the stored hashed keys, the request is allowed to proceed to the protected function. Otherwise, an error (401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden) is returned.

4. **`X-API-Key` Header:**
   - The API key is passed in a custom header `X-API-Key`. Using a header, instead of a query parameter, is slightly more secure as it's less likely to be logged in URLs.  HTTPS is *essential* to encrypt the header.

**Why this is better than storing API keys in plaintext:**

* **Protection Against Data Breaches:** If your API keys database is compromised, attackers only get the hashes, not the actual keys. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
* **Compliance:**  Many security standards and regulations require that sensitive data (like API keys) be stored in a secure manner, including hashing or encryption.

**How to use the code:**

1. **Run the Flask app:** `python your_file_name.py`
2. **Send a request:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-API-Key: secret_api_key" http://localhost:5000/data  # Replace with the actual API key
   ```
   - You *must* include the `X-API-Key` header with the correct API key.  If you don't, you'll get a 401 Unauthorized error.

**Further improvements to consider:**

* **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.  This prevents eavesdropping on the API key.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Log all API requests and monitor for suspicious activity.
* **More Robust Key Storage:**  Use a proper secret management system (like HashiCorp Vault) for storing API keys and other sensitive information.  This is *critical* for production deployments.
* **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
* **IP Whitelisting:**  Restrict access to the API to specific IP addresses.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):** For more complex applications, consider using JWTs instead of simple API keys. JWTs provide more fine-grained control over authorization and can be used to store user-specific information.  They are also better suited for stateless authentication.
* **Consider using `secrets.token_hex()`** To generate a cryptographically secure secret for your api key.

This improved version provides a basic but more secure API key authentication mechanism using hashing, which is a significant step up from storing API keys in plaintext. Remember to adapt the key storage and API key generation to your specific application's needs and security requirements.
