**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security improvement is the addition of **input sanitization** in the `test_get_response_with_special_characters` test. This is crucial to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection attacks against the AI service.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **`import re`**:  Imports the `re` module, which provides regular expression operations.

2. **`sanitized_question = re.sub(r'[^\w\s?]', '', "Test question with !@# special characters.")`**: This line performs the sanitization:
   - `re.sub(r'[^\w\s?]', '', input_string)`: This is the core of the sanitization.  It uses a regular expression to find and replace unwanted characters.
     - `r'[^\w\s?]` : This is the regular expression pattern.  Let's break it down:
       - `[]`: Defines a character class.
       - `^`: Inside a character class, `^` means "not".
       - `\w`: Matches any word character (letters, numbers, and underscore).
       - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
       - `?`: Matches the question mark character literally.  This is intentionally included to allow basic question formation.
       - Together, `[^\w\s?]` means "match any character that is NOT a word character, a whitespace character, or a question mark."
     - `''`:  Specifies that the matched characters should be replaced with an empty string (i.e., removed).
     - `"Test question with !@# special characters."`: This is the input string that needs to be sanitized. In real-world implementation, this would be the user-provided input.

3. **`response = await service.get_response(sanitized_question)`**: The `get_response` function now receives the *sanitized* question instead of the potentially malicious original question.

**Why is this important?**

- **Prompt Injection:**  AI models can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks.  An attacker can craft a malicious input that tricks the AI into performing unintended actions, revealing sensitive information, or modifying its behavior.  Special characters and carefully crafted prompts can be used to bypass security measures and manipulate the AI.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** By removing potentially harmful characters before they reach the AI service, you significantly reduce the attack surface and make it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Context-Specific Sanitization:**  The specific sanitization rules should be tailored to the expected input and the potential threats.  The regular expression `[^\w\s?]` is a starting point. You might need to allow other characters (e.g., periods, commas, other punctuation) depending on the use case. The goal is to allow valid input while blocking potentially dangerous input.
- **Defense in Depth:** Input sanitization is just one layer of security. It should be combined with other measures, such as:
    - **Rate limiting:**  To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    - **Content filtering:**  To detect and block malicious or inappropriate content in both input and output.
    - **Regular security audits:** To identify and address vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Granting minimal necessary access to the AI model and related resources.

This improved code provides a basic example of input sanitization.  In a production environment, you would need to implement more robust and context-aware sanitization logic.
