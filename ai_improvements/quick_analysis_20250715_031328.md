## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:** Utilize a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` to ensure consistent code style across all 21 files. This improves readability, maintainability, and reduces potential bugs. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, consider increasing test coverage, especially for core components like `app/models/product.py`. Aim for a coverage percentage target (e.g., 80%) using a tool like `pytest-cov`. This will help catch regressions and improve code reliability.
