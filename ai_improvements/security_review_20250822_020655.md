**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security improvement implemented is **input sanitization** using the `bleach` library.

*   **Vulnerability:** The original code directly used the `keyword` provided by the user in the `search_products` function. If this keyword were to contain malicious code (e.g., HTML or JavaScript injection), it could potentially be executed depending on how the `local_service.search_products` function handles the keyword. This is a classic example of an injection vulnerability.

*   **Solution:** The `bleach.clean(keyword)` line sanitizes the input `keyword` before it's passed to the `local_service.search_products` function. Bleach removes or escapes potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes, preventing the execution of malicious code. By sanitizing the input, we mitigate the risk of injection attacks.

*   **Why Bleach:** `bleach` is a robust and well-maintained library specifically designed for sanitizing HTML and text. It allows you to define which tags and attributes are allowed, providing fine-grained control over the sanitization process. In this case, we're using the default settings, which are generally safe.  You can configure bleach further to allow or disallow specific HTML tags and attributes based on your application's needs.

**Why only this one improvement?**

The prompt asked for *ONE* security improvement. Input sanitization is often the highest priority when user-provided data is being used to perform actions.  Other potential improvements might include rate limiting, authentication/authorization, or more detailed error handling, but addressing the injection risk is critical.
