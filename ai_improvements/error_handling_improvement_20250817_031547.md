## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import logging

# Configure logging (optional, but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    try:
        # Add a check that might fail (e.g., database connection)
        # Simulate a potential error:  Remove this for production
        #if settings.database_url is None:
        #   raise ValueError("Database URL is not configured.")

        # Replace this with your actual health check logic
        status = "healthy"
        version = "1.0.0"
        return {"status": status, "version": version}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Health check failed: %s", e)  # Log the full error
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Health check failed: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` block:**  The crucial addition.  It wraps the potentially failing health check logic.  This is *essential* for robust error handling.

* **`HTTPException`:** Instead of letting the exception crash the server (or return a generic error), we now catch it and raise an `HTTPException`. This signals to FastAPI that an HTTP error occurred, and FastAPI will automatically return an appropriate error response (status code 500, "Internal Server Error").  This provides a much better experience for the client.

* **Detailed Error Message:** The `detail` argument of `HTTPException` includes the original exception `e`. This is hugely helpful for debugging because the client (or whoever monitors the API) will get a useful error message indicating what went wrong.  Crucially, do *not* expose sensitive information in your error messages (e.g., internal file paths, database passwords).  Filter sensitive data before including it in the `detail`.

* **Logging:** The `logging` module is used to log the exception. This is best practice.  It allows you to record error information without directly exposing it to the client.  The `logger.exception` method logs the full traceback, making it much easier to find the root cause of the error.  This is *critical* for debugging in production. Configure your logging to send logs to a file or a dedicated logging service for long-term analysis.

* **Simulated Error:** I added a commented-out line (`if settings.database_url is None: raise ValueError...`) to *simulate* a potential database connection error.  You should replace this with your actual health check logic (e.g., pinging the database, checking disk space, etc.).  This demonstrates how to handle a specific type of error in the health check. Remove the simulated error for production.

* **Clearer Status/Version Assignment:** Assigned the status and version variables before returning. This is a clearer way to define the return value.

* **Error Code:** Using status code 500, "Internal Server Error" is the correct code for situations where the server encounters an unexpected error during the health check.
How to Use:

1. **Replace Placeholder:** Replace the simulated error and the placeholder `status` and `version` assignments with your actual health check logic.  This is where you'll check the status of your database, message queue, or any other critical dependencies.
2. **Configure Logging:** Make sure you configure the `logging` module appropriately for your environment (e.g., logging to a file, using a logging service).
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Test your error handling by intentionally causing errors in your health check logic (e.g., by taking down a database instance).  Verify that you get the expected error response and that the error is logged.

This improved version will make your health check much more robust and easier to debug. Remember to tailor the error handling and logging to the specific requirements of your application.  Don't just copy and paste; understand *why* each change was made.
