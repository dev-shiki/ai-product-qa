```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = 'utf-8'  # Optional, but recommended for consistency

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The most important and easily implementable security improvement here is to **ensure that the `.env` file is properly secured and not committed to version control.**  While the code itself doesn't *directly* handle this aspect, it's critical to emphasize its importance.  This is how you would typically handle this:

1.  **`.gitignore` File:** Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your project (if you don't already have one).  Add `.env` to this file.  This tells Git to ignore the `.env` file and prevent it from being tracked and committed to your repository.

    ```
    .env
    ```

2.  **Alternative Environment Variable Sources (Consider Docker, CI/CD, etc.):**  For production deployments (and even for more robust development environments), *avoid* relying solely on a `.env` file.  Use environment variables that are injected into the environment at runtime.  This is much more secure.  The way you do this depends on your deployment environment:

    *   **Docker:**  Use Docker environment variables (`docker run -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key ...`).
    *   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.):** Store sensitive values as secret variables in your CI/CD platform and inject them into the environment during builds and deployments.
    *   **Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Utilize the cloud provider's secret management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).

**Why is this so important?**

*   **Preventing Exposure of Secrets:**  The `.env` file often contains sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and other credentials. If you accidentally commit it to a public repository (e.g., on GitHub), anyone can access these secrets and potentially compromise your application, infrastructure, or data.
*   **Security Best Practices:**  Storing secrets in version control is a major security no-no.  Treat environment variables and secrets as something that should *never* be committed to code.
* **Defense in depth**:  Even if the .env is accidentally committed, having checks that the values are not default values can mitigate the potential damage by making the API unavailable to the unauthorized user.  The check implemented in the original code in `__init__` is a good example of defense in depth.

**Optional, but Recommended (for robustness):**

*   **`env_file_encoding`:** Added `env_file_encoding='utf-8'` to the `Config` class. This specifies the encoding of the `.env` file.  While often it's implicitly UTF-8, explicitly defining it makes your code more robust and avoids potential encoding-related issues down the line.

**In Summary:**

The *single* most important improvement (though it's not code *in* the file, but *related to* the file) is ensuring the `.env` file is `.gitignore`d and that you avoid committing secrets to version control.  For production, use environment variables injected by your deployment environment or secret management services.
