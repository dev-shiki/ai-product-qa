Given the structure, consider these improvements:

1.  **Improve modularity within `app/api`**: Introduce subdirectories for different API resources (e.g., `/app/api/products/`, `/app/api/users/`). This improves organization and maintainability as your API grows.

2.  **Implement a testing framework beyond basic test files**: Consider using `pytest` or `unittest` with features like test discovery, fixtures, and mocking.  This provides a more robust and structured testing approach.
