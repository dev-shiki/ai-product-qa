**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style with a Linter and Formatter:** Integrate a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black` or `autopep8`) into your development workflow. This ensures consistent code style across all 21 Python files, improving readability and maintainability. Configure them in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check and format code on every commit.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, assess your test coverage using a tool like `coverage.py`. Identify areas with low coverage and write more tests, especially for complex logic in modules like `app/models/product.py`. Aim for high code coverage to catch bugs earlier.
