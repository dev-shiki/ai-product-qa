## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

from app.main import app  # Import app globally for use in the fixture


@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    """
    Async pytest fixture that yields an httpx AsyncClient instance configured for testing the FastAPI app.
    It handles setup (creating the client) and teardown (closing the client) automatically.
    """
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
        yield client


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root(async_client: AsyncClient):
    response = await async_client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health(async_client: AsyncClient):
    response = await async_client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Refactoring Improvement:**  Introduce a pytest fixture for the `AsyncClient`.

**Explanation:**

The original code repeated the `AsyncClient` setup in both test functions. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  By creating a fixture `async_client`, we:

1.  **Centralize Client Setup:** The `AsyncClient` is now created and configured in a single place (the fixture).
2.  **Reduce Redundancy:** Test functions no longer need to duplicate the client setup code.
3.  **Improve Maintainability:** If the `AsyncClient` configuration needs to change (e.g., different base URL, additional headers), you only need to modify it in the fixture.
4.  **Improve Readability:** The test functions become cleaner and easier to understand, focusing solely on the test logic.
5.  **Automatic Resource Management:** The fixture handles the asynchronous context management (`async with`) to ensure the client is properly closed after each test that uses it, preventing resource leaks.
6.  **Global app import**: Importing app in the test functions makes it difficult to change and debug if the import path changes. Moving the import outside makes this easier.
7.  **Type Hinting:** added `async_client: AsyncClient` to test functions to improve type checking and clarity.

The `async_client` fixture is a powerful way to manage resources and dependencies within pytest asynchronous tests.
