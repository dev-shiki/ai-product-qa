**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Increase Test Coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, there's likely room to improve test coverage. Aim for unit tests that specifically target different functions or classes within modules such as `./app/api/queries.py` and `./app/api/products.py`.

2.  **Enforce Code Style:** Implement a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a code formatter (like Black) to ensure consistent code style across all files. This will improve readability, maintainability, and collaboration. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to automate this process.
