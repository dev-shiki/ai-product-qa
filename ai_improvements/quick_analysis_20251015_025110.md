**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Increase test coverage:** With 21 Python files and only 8 test files, the ratio suggests potentially low coverage.  Analyze which modules lack tests and prioritize writing unit tests for core functionalities and complex logic in modules like `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`. Aim for a good balance between unit and integration tests.

2.  **Enforce consistent style:** Implement a linter (like Flake8) and a code formatter (like Black) to maintain code consistency across all files. This will improve readability and reduce merge conflicts. Integrate these tools into your development workflow.
