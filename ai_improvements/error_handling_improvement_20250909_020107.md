## Improvement

```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword}, limit: {limit}")
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword}")
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword: {keyword}, limit: {limit}")  # Log the full exception
            return []
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception()` instead of `logger.error()`:** This is the most crucial change.  `logger.exception()` automatically logs the exception *message* *and* the stack trace.  This is absolutely essential for debugging because it tells you *exactly* where the error occurred in the code.  Without the stack trace, you often only have a vague idea of what went wrong.  `logger.error()` only logs the message, discarding the valuable traceback information.

* **Include all relevant parameters in the log message:** The logging statement now includes both the `keyword` and the `limit` used in the `search_products` function call. This is essential for debugging. When an error occurs, you know exactly what parameters were used when the error occurred.

Why these changes are important:

1. **Debugging Efficiency:**  A stack trace is critical for quickly pinpointing the source of errors, especially in complex systems. Without it, you waste time trying to reproduce the error and step through the code.

2. **Complete Error Context:** Including the input parameters (keyword, limit) in the log message gives you the complete context of the function call that failed.  This is extremely helpful for understanding *why* the error might have occurred (e.g., a specific keyword caused a problem).

3. **Maintainability:**  Good error logging significantly improves the maintainability of your code.  When issues arise in production, detailed logs allow you to diagnose and fix them quickly and efficiently.
