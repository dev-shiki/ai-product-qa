## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            # Provide more context in the exception message, including potential causes and solutions.
            raise ValueError(
                "GOOGLE_API_KEY is missing or invalid. Please ensure it is set correctly in the .env file "
                "or as an environment variable.  Double-check the .env file exists and is in the correct directory."
            )
        if not isinstance(self.API_PORT, int):
            logger.error(f"API_PORT is not an integer: {self.API_PORT}")
            raise ValueError("API_PORT must be an integer.")
        if not isinstance(self.FRONTEND_PORT, int):
            logger.error(f"FRONTEND_PORT is not an integer: {self.FRONTEND_PORT}")
            raise ValueError("FRONTEND_PORT must be an integer.")


@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    try:
        return Settings()
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.critical(f"Failed to load settings: {e}")
        # Optionally, you could re-raise the exception or exit the program.
        # Raising the exception will stop the program.
        raise
        # Alternatively, exit gracefully (if possible):
        # import sys
        # sys.exit(1)

settings = get_settings()
```

Key improvements:

* **More informative `ValueError` message:** The exception message now includes guidance on how to resolve the issue (check .env file, environment variables, and file existence).  This makes debugging significantly easier. It now also checks for integer type of the ports.

* **Error handling in `get_settings`:** The `get_settings` function now includes a `try...except` block to catch the `ValueError` that might be raised during `Settings` initialization.  This is crucial because it prevents the application from crashing silently if the settings are invalid.  The `logger.critical` message ensures that the error is prominently logged.  Critically, the example now re-raises the exception, stopping the program. This is generally the desired behavior as the application cannot function correctly without proper settings. Alternative graceful exit is provided via commented out code.

* **Clarity and maintainability:** The improved code is more explicit about the potential errors and how to handle them, making it easier to understand and maintain.

This revised version provides significantly better error handling, making the application more robust and easier to debug.  The added context in the error message helps users quickly identify and resolve configuration problems. The `try...except` block in `get_settings` prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the application.  Checking for integer types adds a layer of validation.
