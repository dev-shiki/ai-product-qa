## Quick Insights

Given the project structure with a reasonable number of files and dedicated tests, two quick improvements could be:

1.  **Linting & Formatting:**  Implement a consistent code style (e.g., using Black and Flake8) across all files.  This enhances readability and maintainability.  Automated linting can catch common errors before runtime.

2.  **Testing Coverage:** Evaluate and improve test coverage.  Aim for high coverage, especially for critical modules like `app/models/product.py`.  Use a coverage tool to identify untested code paths and write new tests accordingly. This reduces the risk of regressions.
