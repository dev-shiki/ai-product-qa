## Quick Insights

1. **Implement Linting and Formatting:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability, maintainability, and reduces stylistic disagreements. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks on every commit.

2. **Centralize Configuration:** If configuration is scattered across files, consolidate it into a dedicated configuration module or use environment variables. This makes managing settings easier, especially for different environments (development, testing, production).
