**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security improvement addresses **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.

*   **XSS Prevention:** The code now uses the `bleach` library to sanitize user-provided inputs, specifically the `keyword` in `search_products`, `search` in `get_products`, and `category` in `get_products`. This sanitization removes or escapes potentially malicious HTML tags or JavaScript code that an attacker might inject into these input fields.  By sanitizing these inputs, the code prevents the injected script from being executed in the user's browser, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.

    *   `bleach.clean(keyword)`:  This line cleans the `keyword` variable before it's used in the search query or logged.  `bleach` removes any potentially harmful HTML tags or attributes, preventing malicious scripts from being injected and executed.
    *   Same implementation for `search` and `category` parameters.

**Why XSS is a Concern:**

XSS attacks can have severe consequences, including:

*   Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacing websites.
*   Injecting malware.

**Why this improvement is important in the context of the provided code:**

The `ProductDataService` likely handles user-supplied search terms. Without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the search query.  This script could then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the search results, potentially compromising their accounts or systems.

**Additional Considerations (Beyond the Single Suggestion):**

*   **Input Validation:** While sanitization is essential, input validation should also be implemented.  For example, setting maximum lengths for input fields and restricting allowed characters.
*   **Output Encoding:** Ensure that any data retrieved from the database or other sources is properly encoded before being displayed to the user.  This prevents the browser from misinterpreting data as executable code.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to control the sources from which the browser can load resources, further mitigating XSS risks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

This single change significantly improves the security of the application by mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.  Remember to install the bleach library using `pip install bleach`.
