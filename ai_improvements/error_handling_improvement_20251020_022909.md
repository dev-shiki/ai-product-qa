## Improvement

```python

from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",

        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products_with_category(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,

            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
... (truncated for brevity, same changes apply here as well)
```

Key improvements:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`:** This crucial line adds explicit error checking for HTTP status codes.  If the response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception, which is then caught.  This prevents the test from continuing with potentially invalid data and allows you to handle HTTP errors specifically.
* **`try...except` block:**  A `try...except` block is added around the `ac.get()` call to catch potential exceptions during the HTTP request.  This handles `HTTPStatusError` specifically (using `resp.raise_for_status()`) and catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur during the request (e.g., network issues, timeouts, etc.).
* **Specific exception handling:** Catches `HTTPStatusError` to provide a more informative failure message, specifically indicating an HTTP error.
* **Generic exception handling:** Catches a generic `Exception` to handle unexpected errors and provide a failure message, preventing the test from passing silently when an unexpected error occurs.
* **`pytest.fail()`:** Instead of just letting the test crash, `pytest.fail()` is used to explicitly mark the test as failed with a descriptive error message. This makes it much clearer why the test failed. The error message includes the specific exception that was raised, which helps in debugging.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The use of `try...except` makes the error handling logic explicit and easy to understand.

This improved version provides more robust error handling for the HTTP request, ensuring that tests fail gracefully and provide meaningful error messages when something goes wrong during the request.  This is significantly better than the original code, which would just continue execution with potentially invalid data or crash without a clear explanation.  Remember to apply the same changes to the second test function as well.
