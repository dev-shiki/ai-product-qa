**Time**: 04:26:02  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider adding a linter and formatter like Flake8 and Black.** This enforces consistent code style across all 21 files, improving readability and reducing potential errors.  Integrating these into your CI/CD pipeline would ensure consistent code quality.

2.  **Evaluate test coverage.** With only 8 test files for 21 code files, it's likely some code isn't being adequately tested. Tools like `coverage` can identify untested areas. Prioritize testing crucial modules like `./app/models/product.py` and core logic in `./app/main.py`.
