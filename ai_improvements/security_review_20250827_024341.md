## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    health_data = response.json()
    assert health_data["status"] == "healthy"
    #Read the version from environment variable
    expected_version = os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0") # Default to 1.0.0 if not set
    assert health_data["version"] == expected_version

```

**Security Improvement:** **Configuration of version number**

**Explanation:**

The original code hardcoded the expected version number `"1.0.0"` directly into the test. This is a bad practice because:

1.  **Code Changes Required for Version Updates:**  Every time the API version is updated, the test code needs to be modified.  This adds unnecessary overhead and increases the risk of human error (e.g., forgetting to update the test or introducing a typo).

2.  **Lack of Environment Awareness:**  The tests aren't aware of the environment they're running in.  In a real-world deployment, the version might be set via environment variables (e.g., in a Docker container or CI/CD pipeline).

3.  **Security Implication :** Hardcoding version information makes it difficult to manage and track the current version and possible to introduce outdated version

**Secured Code Explanation:**

1.  **`import os`:** Imports the `os` module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, including accessing environment variables.

2.  **`expected_version = os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")`:** This line retrieves the API version from an environment variable named `API_VERSION`.
    *   `os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")` attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable `API_VERSION`.
    *   If the `API_VERSION` environment variable is not set, it defaults to `"1.0.0"`. This provides a fallback value if the environment isn't explicitly configured.

3.  **`assert health_data["version"] == expected_version`:** The test now compares the `version` field from the `/health` endpoint response with the value retrieved from the environment variable.

**How it improves security:**

*   **Simplified Version Management:** The API version can be updated by simply changing the value of the `API_VERSION` environment variable, without modifying the test code. This reduces the chance of errors and makes deployments more streamlined.
*   **Dynamic Version Checking:**  The tests can now dynamically verify the correct version based on the environment they are running in.
*   **Enhanced Security Monitoring:** By storing version in the environment, we can easily track and monitor which version is deployed, enabling efficient security monitoring.
*   **Reduced Attack Surface:** By not embedding hardcoded values, potential attackers are restricted from exploiting hardcoded version numbers.

This approach makes the tests more robust, maintainable, and aligned with best practices for application configuration in modern deployment environments.  It also promotes a clearer separation of concerns between the test code and the environment it's running in.
