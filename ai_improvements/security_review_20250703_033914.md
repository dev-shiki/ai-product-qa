## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Restrict CORS origins to a specific list (or environment variable)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "http://localhost:3000").split(",")  # Default to localhost, but override with env var

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The critical security improvement is replacing `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware` with a specific, restricted set of origins defined in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

**Why this is important:**

*   **CORS and Security:**  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one which served the web page. `allow_origins=["*"]` disables this protection entirely, meaning *any* website can make requests to your API.  This opens up significant security risks, like:
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can trick a user into performing actions on your API without their knowledge.  For example, if your API allows product purchases and `allow_origins=["*"]`, an attacker could embed malicious JavaScript on their website that initiates a purchase on your user's behalf.
    *   **Data Theft:** If your API returns sensitive data (even if it's not directly exposed to users), a malicious website could retrieve and steal that data.

*   **Controlled Access:** By specifying `allow_origins` with a list of allowed domains (e.g., `["http://localhost:3000", "https://your-production-site.com"]`), you restrict access to only the websites that you explicitly trust.  This greatly reduces the attack surface.

*   **Environment Configuration:** Using `os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "http://localhost:3000").split(",")` makes the allowed origins configurable via an environment variable.  This is crucial for deploying to different environments (development, staging, production) where the allowed origins will likely be different.  The default value ensures that your API works in a development environment (e.g., accessed from a local React application).  The `.split(",")` allows you to define multiple origins, separated by commas, within the environment variable.

**How to use it:**

1.  **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:**  Before running your application in a production environment, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of your allowed origins.  For example:

    ```bash
    export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-production-site.com,https://another-trusted-site.com"
    ```

2.  **Run your FastAPI application:** When your application starts, it will read the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable and use those origins for CORS configuration.

**In Summary:**  Limiting `allow_origins` in CORS configuration is a fundamental security practice.  Failing to do so can leave your API vulnerable to various attacks.  By using a specific list of origins (ideally configured via an environment variable), you significantly improve the security of your application.
