**Reasoning for Security Improvement:**

The original code lacked any input validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to various injection attacks, particularly XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and SQL injection. While these tests are mocking the AI service's response, they should still simulate potential malicious inputs to ensure that the `AIService` is designed to handle them safely in a real-world deployment.  Since we don't see the actual `AIService` code, we cannot implement the real fix there, but we can at least add test cases that *should* be failing if the `AIService` isn't validating and sanitizing input.

The added test cases address this by:

1.  **`test_get_response_with_xss_attempt()`**: This test sends a question containing a simple XSS payload (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). In a production environment, if the `AIService` doesn't sanitize the input, this script could be executed in the user's browser when the response is displayed, leading to potential security breaches. The assertion checks that the expected error message "Pertanyaan tidak valid" is returned, indicating that the service *should* detect and reject the malicious input.

2.  **`test_get_response_with_sql_injection_attempt()`**: This test sends a question that resembles a SQL injection attempt (`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;--`).  Even if the AI model itself is not directly accessing a database, it could be used to construct SQL queries in other parts of the system.  The assertion checks for the "Pertanyaan tidak valid" message, indicating the service *should* be protected against SQL injection attempts.

3. `test_get_response_with_special_characters()`: This checks how the system handles unexpected special characters.  While not directly a security vulnerability like XSS or SQL injection, it's good practice to ensure that the application behaves predictably when presented with unusual inputs.

**Important Considerations (Beyond the Test Code):**

*   **Real Input Validation/Sanitization in `AIService`**: The most important security improvement needs to happen within the `AIService` class itself.  This should involve:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Verify that the question meets certain criteria (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters).
    *   **Input Sanitization/Escaping:**  Remove or encode potentially harmful characters, especially HTML entities, to prevent XSS.
    *   **Output Encoding:** When displaying the AI service's response, ensure that the output is properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: The AI service should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform its tasks.

*   **Regular Security Audits**:  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

This improved code provides a more secure testing framework by adding specific test cases for common injection vulnerabilities.  Remember that the most critical part of security is the actual implementation within the `AIService` class, where input validation and sanitization should occur.  The tests are now designed to confirm that those measures are in place (or, more likely, to highlight their absence and prompt their implementation).
