## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Restrict CORS origins to specific, known origins instead of allowing all.
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "").split(",")  # Retrieve allowed origins from environment variable

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,  # Use the environment variable for allowed origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The original code uses `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`.  This means that any website from any origin can make requests to your API. This is a significant security risk because it opens your API up to potential Cross-Origin Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  Malicious websites could potentially make requests on behalf of your users without their knowledge.

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.  Here's a breakdown of the changes and why it's more secure:

1. **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "").split(",")`**:
   - This line retrieves the allowed origins from an environment variable named `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.  Storing configuration values (especially sensitive ones like allowed origins) in environment variables is a best practice. It allows you to easily change the allowed origins without modifying the code itself and redeploying. This is particularly useful in production environments.  The `.split(",")` part splits the environment variable's value (which is assumed to be a comma-separated list of origins) into a Python list.
   - The `os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "")` also has a default value of `""` which ensures the application doesn't crash if the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable isn't set.  However, it's important to *always* set this variable in production.

2. **`allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`**:
   - The `CORSMiddleware` now uses the list of allowed origins retrieved from the environment variable.  Only requests from origins specified in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable will be allowed.

**How to use the improved code:**

1. **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:**
   - Before running your FastAPI application, you need to set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.  The way you do this depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  Here are a few examples:

     * **Linux/macOS:**
       ```bash
       export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"
       ```
     * **Windows (Command Prompt):**
       ```
       set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com
       ```
     * **Windows (PowerShell):**
       ```powershell
       $env:ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"
       ```

     * **Docker:** When running with Docker, you would pass the environment variable when running the container:

       ```bash
       docker run -e ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com" your_image_name
       ```

2. **Run your FastAPI application:**
   - After setting the environment variable, run your FastAPI application as usual.  The application will now use the allowed origins you specified.

**Example:**

If you set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://www.example.com"`, then:

- Requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `https://www.example.com` will be allowed.
- Requests from any other origin (e.g., `https://evil.com`) will be blocked by the CORS policy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Carefully consider which origins you allow.  Only allow origins that you trust.
*   **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode sensitive information like allowed origins directly in your code.  Use environment variables.
*   **Wildcards:** Avoid using wildcards (`*`) unless absolutely necessary and you fully understand the security implications.  They bypass the intended protection of CORS.
*   **Deployment:** Ensure your deployment environment correctly sets the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.
*   **Development vs. Production:**  You might use a different set of allowed origins in development (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) than in production.
*   **Regular Updates:** Periodically review and update your allowed origins as needed.
