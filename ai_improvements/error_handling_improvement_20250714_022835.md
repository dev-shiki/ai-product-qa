## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    try:
        # Simulate a potential error (e.g., checking database connection)
        # In a real application, replace this with your actual health check logic
        # For example:
        # await database.check_connection()
        
        # This part can be removed for dummy error simulation
        # if settings.database_url is None:  # Example using settings
        #     raise Exception("Database URL not configured")

        return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error for debugging purposes (important for production)
        print(f"Health check failed: {e}")  # Consider using a proper logging library
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Health check failed: {str(e)}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` Block:** The core improvement is wrapping the health check logic within a `try...except` block. This allows us to gracefully handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the health check.
* **Specific Exception Handling (Optional but Recommended):** Ideally, you would catch specific exception types (e.g., `DatabaseConnectionError`, `TimeoutError`) instead of a generic `Exception`. This allows you to tailor the error response based on the specific problem.  However, for the sake of demonstrating the basic principle when the exact errors are unknown, I used a general exception.
* **Detailed Error Message:** The `detail` field in the `HTTPException` is now populated with the string representation of the exception (`str(e)`). This provides valuable information to the client about why the health check failed.  Without it, the client only receives the HTTP status code, which isn't very helpful for diagnosing the problem.
* **HTTP 500 Status Code:**  When a health check fails, an `HTTPException` is raised with a `status_code` of 500 (Internal Server Error).  This is the appropriate status code to indicate that something went wrong on the server side.
* **Logging (Crucial for Production):**  The `print(f"Health check failed: {e}")` line is a placeholder for proper logging.  In a production environment, you should use a dedicated logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python's standard library, or a third-party library like `loguru`) to record the error message along with other relevant information (timestamp, request details, etc.).  Logging is essential for debugging and monitoring your application's health.
* **Simulated Error:**  I've included a commented-out example that simulates an error by checking if the database URL is configured.  Replace this with your actual health check logic.
* **Why not raise immediately?**  Simply raising the original exception without wrapping it in an `HTTPException` would result in an unhandled exception, which would cause the server to return a generic error response (usually a 500 Internal Server Error) *without* any helpful information about the cause of the failure.  FastAPI's exception handlers can catch such unhandled exceptions, but it's better to handle them explicitly and provide a more informative response.  Furthermore, catching the exception gives you the opportunity to log the error.
* **Keep it concise:** This response focuses only on improving the health check, as requested. The other parts of the code are unchanged.

This improved version provides a more robust and informative health check endpoint, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues in your application.  Remember to replace the simulated error and logging placeholder with your actual implementation.
