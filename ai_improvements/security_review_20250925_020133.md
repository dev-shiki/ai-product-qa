## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, description="Maximum number of products to return"),
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(
    query: str,
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, description="Maximum number of search results")
):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, description="Maximum number of top-rated products")
):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

**Explanation of Improvement:**

The key security improvement is adding validation to the `limit` parameter using `Query`.

Specifically:

*   **Input Validation:**  The `limit` parameter, used in several endpoints (`get_products`, `search_products`, `get_top_rated_products`), is now validated using `Query(default_value, le=max_value, description="...")`.

    *   `Query(default_value)`: Specifies that the parameter is a query parameter and provides a default value if the client doesn't provide one.
    *   `le=max_value`:  This is the crucial security part. It enforces that the `limit` value is "less than or equal to" `max_value`.  This prevents a malicious user from specifying extremely large `limit` values that could potentially overload the server (DoS attack) or retrieve excessive amounts of data (performance degradation or information exposure).  Reasonable maximum limits (e.g., 100 for `get_products`, 50 for `search_products` and `get_top_rated_products`) are set.
    * `description`: adds OpenAPI documentation that informs the users about the query parameter.

**Why this is a security improvement:**

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention:** Without validation, an attacker could set `limit` to an extremely high value (e.g., `limit=999999999`).  The server would then attempt to retrieve and process a massive amount of data. This could exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) and potentially crash the application or make it unresponsive to legitimate users. Limiting the maximum allowed value for `limit` mitigates this risk.

2.  **Data Exposure Limitation:** Even if the server doesn't crash, retrieving a very large number of products could expose more data than intended. This could be a concern if product information is sensitive or if there are limitations on how much data should be exposed in a single request.

3.  **Resource Management:** Validating and limiting the number of returned results leads to better resource utilization and scaling capabilities.

By adding this simple validation, the application becomes significantly more resilient to potential attacks and more robust in handling user requests. The use of `Query` from FastAPI provides a clean and declarative way to define and validate query parameters.
