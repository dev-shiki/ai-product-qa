## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Replace `monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")` with `monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", os.environ.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key"))`

**Explanation:**

This change makes the tests more robust by ensuring they continue to function as intended even if the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is already set outside the test environment (e.g., in the developer's shell).

Instead of directly overriding the environment variable with a hardcoded value, it now first checks if the variable is already set. If it is, it uses the existing value; otherwise, it defaults to "dummy-key". This prevents unexpected behavior if the tests are run in an environment where `GOOGLE_API_KEY` has a specific value that should not be overwritten during testing.  It's generally better practice to respect existing environment configurations unless there's a specific reason to override them unconditionally.
