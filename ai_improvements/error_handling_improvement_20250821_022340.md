    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """

            elif category:
                return await self.get_products_by_category(category, limit) #Fixed - await was missing for async method
            else:

        except Exception as e:

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception` instead of `logger.error`**:  Crucially, `logger.exception` logs the *entire* stack trace, not just the error message. This makes debugging significantly easier, as you can see exactly where the error occurred in the code.
* **Added Context to Log Messages:** The log messages now include the values of the input parameters (keyword, limit, category, search) that were used when the error occurred.  This makes it much easier to diagnose issues, as you know the exact circumstances that led to the error.
* **Clearer Fallback Logic in `get_products`:** The code now explicitly logs a message when it falls back to `LocalProductService.get_products`. This makes it clear in the logs that the primary data source failed and that the code is using a backup.  Also, the `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` were not awaited, resulting in possible unhandled exceptions, now fixed.
* **Fallback Error Handling:** The `get_products` method now includes a `try...except` block around the fallback call to `self.local_service.get_products`. This ensures that if even the fallback fails, the code will still handle the error gracefully and return an empty list to avoid crashing. The error in the fallback is also logged.
* **Consistency:**  Applied `logger.exception` consistently throughout the relevant `except` blocks.
* **Return Values:** Always returns an empty list `[]` in the event of an unrecoverable error.  This is a safe and predictable default.  Avoid returning `None` or raising exceptions unless it's truly unrecoverable and the caller *must* know about it.
* **Await async methods:**  `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` are presumably async, so calls to them needed to be awaited.

This revised code provides much better error handling, logging, and resilience, making it easier to debug and maintain.  The use of `logger.exception` is particularly important, as it provides the full stack trace needed to diagnose the root cause of errors.  The added context in the log messages is also crucial for understanding the circumstances that led to the errors.
