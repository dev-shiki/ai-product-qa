## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1. **Modularize `main.py`:**  A single `main.py` often becomes a dumping ground. Break down its functionality into smaller modules within the `app` directory. This improves readability, testability, and maintainability by promoting separation of concerns.

2. **Improve Test Coverage:** With 21 Python files and only 8 test files, it's likely that certain modules or functionalities are not being adequately tested.  Prioritize writing tests for core logic and complex functions, aiming for higher overall test coverage to ensure robustness.
