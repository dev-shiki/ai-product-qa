## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, status
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Initialize logger


@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except ValueError as ve:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid input: {ve}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(ve))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error fetching products")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve products due to an internal error.")


@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error fetching categories")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve categories due to an internal error.")


@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except ValueError as ve:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid input: {ve}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(ve))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error during search")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to search products due to an internal error.")


@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error fetching top-rated products")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="Failed to retrieve top-rated products due to an internal error.")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Specific Exception Handling (ValueError):**  The original code caught *all* exceptions in a single `except Exception as e`.  This is generally bad practice because it makes debugging difficult and can mask issues.  The improved code adds a `except ValueError as ve:` block in the `get_products` and `search_products` functions. This is important because it's likely that `product_service.get_products` might raise a `ValueError` if it receives invalid input (e.g., a negative limit, a category that doesn't exist).  By catching `ValueError` specifically, we can provide a more informative error message and a more appropriate HTTP status code (400 Bad Request).

* **Informative Error Messages:** Instead of just returning `str(e)` in the `HTTPException`, the code now provides more user-friendly error messages like `"Failed to retrieve products due to an internal error."` This is much better for the API consumer.  The `ValueError` details are still passed, but they should be input validation related.

* **Logging:**  Crucially, I've added logging using Python's `logging` module.
    * `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` initializes a logger for the current module.
    * `logger.exception("Unexpected error fetching products")` logs the full exception traceback, which is *invaluable* for debugging production issues.  The `.exception()` method automatically includes the exception information.  The logging statement clarifies the context of the error.
    * `logger.warning(f"Invalid input: {ve}")` logs a warning with the `ValueError` detail.
* **HTTP Status Codes:** Using the correct HTTP status code is essential.  I've replaced `500` with `status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` and added `status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST` for value errors. This makes the API more RESTful and easier to understand.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The changes improve the overall readability and maintainability of the code.

How to use the logger:

1.  **Configure Logging:** You'll need to configure the `logging` module in your main application.  A basic example:

    ```python
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,  # Or logging.DEBUG for more detail
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    ```

    This will log messages to the console. You can configure it to log to files, send to monitoring services, etc.  See the Python `logging` documentation for full details.

2.  **Run your FastAPI application.** When an error occurs in the `get_products` endpoint, you'll see the detailed traceback in your logs (either in the console or in the log file, depending on your configuration).  This will tell you exactly where the error occurred in the `product_service` code.
This revised code provides a much more robust and informative error handling strategy.  Remember to configure logging properly in your application's startup.  Good error handling and logging are *essential* for building reliable APIs.
