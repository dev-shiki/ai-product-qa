```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1),  # Added query validation
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(
    query: str,
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1)  # Added query validation

    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1)  # Added query validation
):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)

**Explanation of Improvement:**

The primary security improvement is adding **input validation** using `Query` parameters with `le` (less than or equal to) and `ge` (greater than or equal to) constraints for the `limit` parameter in the `get_products`, `search_products`, and `get_top_rated_products` routes.

*   **Why it's important:** Without input validation, an attacker could potentially supply extremely large values for the `limit` parameter. This could lead to:
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack:** The server might try to retrieve and process an excessive amount of data, exhausting resources (CPU, memory, database connections) and causing the service to become slow or unavailable.
    *   **Database overload:** The database might be overwhelmed by a query requesting an extremely large number of rows.

*   **How it works:**
    *   `Query(20, le=100, ge=1)`: This specifies that the `limit` parameter is a query parameter (passed in the URL).
    *   `20`:  This is the default value for the `limit` parameter if the user doesn't provide one in the query.
    *   `le=100`:  This constraint ensures that the value of `limit` cannot be greater than 100.
    *   `ge=1`: This constraint ensures that the value of `limit` cannot be less than 1.

By adding these constraints, we limit the maximum number of products that can be retrieved in a single request, preventing potential resource exhaustion attacks.  The exact upper and lower bounds should be determined based on your specific application's requirements and resources.  I chose 100 and 1 as plausible examples. This also improves the usability of your API, as requests for very large limits may take an unacceptably long time to complete.

This change prevents an attacker from requesting an excessive amount of data at once, making the application more robust and secure.  It also makes the `limit` value in each endpoint clearer by explicitly setting the default values.
