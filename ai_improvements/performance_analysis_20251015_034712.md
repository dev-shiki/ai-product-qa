            else:

        """Get products by category"""

            # Simulate an async operation
            await asyncio.sleep(0.01)  # Replace with actual async category fetching logic
            return self.local_service.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting products by category: {str(e)}")

        try:
             # Simulate an async operation
            await asyncio.sleep(0.01)  # Replace with actual async all products fetching logic
            return self.local_service.get_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error getting all products: {str(e)}")
            return []
```

**Justification:**

The primary performance improvement is adding `await` before the calls to `self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)` and `self.get_all_products(limit)` within the `get_products` method.  Currently, these calls are made without `await`, meaning the coroutines they return are not being executed.  This effectively renders those branches of the logic synchronous, blocking the event loop and preventing other tasks from running concurrently.

By adding `await`, we ensure that the coroutines returned by `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` are properly executed, allowing the asynchronous code to function as intended and improve overall responsiveness and performance. Additionally, stubs for  `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` are added with a sleep to exemplify their asynchronous nature.  Without these additions, the original code would essentially bypass asynchronous execution in these scenarios.  If `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products` *were* synchronous, then they should be executed in the executor, like search_products.  However, the intention of the example seems to be for these to be asynchronous functions.

Furthermore, a minor change was made by retrieving the event loop once.

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
```

Was turned into

```python
products = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
```

As the loop variable was only used once and does not need to be cached.
