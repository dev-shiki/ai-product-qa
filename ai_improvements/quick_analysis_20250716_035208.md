## Quick Insights

Given the size, focus on maintainability and robustness.

1.  **Introduce a linter/formatter (e.g., Black, Flake8):**  Enforce consistent coding style across all files, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Automated formatting saves development time and ensures codebase uniformity.

2.  **Consider using a dependency management tool (e.g., Poetry, pipenv):** While not apparent if needed without seeing `requirements.txt`, using a tool to manage dependencies helps ensure consistent and reproducible environments, particularly important with multiple files and testing.
