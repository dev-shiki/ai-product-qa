# Code Optimization

**File**: `./frontend/streamlit_app.py`

**Type**: code_optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:**  Use `st.cache_data` to cache the results of API calls.

**Explanation:**  This code likely makes API calls to `API_BASE_URL`.  API calls are typically slow due to network latency.  By using `@st.cache_data` on functions that make these calls, Streamlit will store the results of the function in a cache. Subsequent calls with the same input parameters will retrieve the results from the cache instead of making a new API request, significantly speeding up the app, especially when the API data doesn't change frequently.  This is a very common and highly effective optimization in Streamlit apps that interact with external data sources.  No context is needed to apply this because we can see the code makes API calls and that these calls are likely the source of performance issues.
