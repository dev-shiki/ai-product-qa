## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    # Use an environment variable for the version to prevent hardcoding sensitive information.
    expected_version = os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")  # Default to "1.0.0" if not set
    assert response.json()["version"] == expected_version
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is to **avoid hardcoding the `version` string directly in the test code.**  Hardcoding values like this, especially those that could be considered configuration data, introduces several risks:

1. **Information Disclosure:**  The version number might reveal implementation details.  While a simple version number isn't usually a critical security risk, it's good practice to avoid unnecessary information exposure, especially in larger projects where the version could correlate to specific vulnerabilities.

2. **Maintenance Overhead:**  If the version needs to be updated, you have to modify and redeploy the test code *and* the application code.  This increases the chance of errors.

3. **Inconsistent Configuration:**  If tests and the application get out of sync with respect to the version, tests can fail unexpectedly, leading to confusion and wasted effort.

**How the Code Addresses the Improvement:**

*   **`os.environ.get("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")`:**  This line retrieves the value of the environment variable `API_VERSION`.
    *   **`os.environ.get()`** is used to access environment variables, which are typically configured outside the codebase (e.g., in a Dockerfile, a CI/CD pipeline, or the operating system itself).
    *   **`"API_VERSION"`** is the name of the environment variable we're trying to read.  Choose a descriptive name.
    *   **`"1.0.0"`** is the default value.  If the `API_VERSION` environment variable is *not* set, the test will use "1.0.0" as the expected version.  This ensures the test still works even without explicit configuration.

**How to Use This:**

1.  **Set the `API_VERSION` environment variable.**  How you do this depends on your environment. For example, in a Dockerfile:

    ```dockerfile
    ENV API_VERSION="2.0.0"
    ```

    Or in a shell before running the tests:

    ```bash
    export API_VERSION="2.0.0"
    pytest
    ```

2.  **Ensure the application's `/health` endpoint also reads its version from the same environment variable.**  This ensures consistency between the test and the application.  If the application hardcodes the version, the test will fail if the environment variable differs from the hardcoded version.

By using an environment variable, you make the test more configurable, improve information security by avoiding hardcoding, and reduce maintenance burden. This approach makes the deployment and testing process more robust and easier to manage.
