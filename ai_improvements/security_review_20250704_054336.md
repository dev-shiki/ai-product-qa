# Suggestion:  If the code interacts with the file system, ensure proper sanitization of file paths and avoid constructing paths dynamically from user input (if any). In the present code snippet, there is no file system interaction.  So, let us assume that the `LocalProductService` reads data from a file. Then, we need to validate path. This would not be needed for static data defined within the python code itself.
# However, as a general security practice, if the code deals with filesystem paths, it's beneficial to use mechanisms to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities, particularly if part of the path is ever derived from external input.  Since that is not immediately apparent, I'm skipping adding the path sanitization directly into the fixture and rather suggesting this in the explanation.

# Explanation of the security improvement:

# **Path Traversal Prevention (if applicable to LocalProductService data loading):**
# Assuming `LocalProductService` reads from a file.  The principle would be as follows:

#  1. **Validate the Path:** Before using any user-provided input (or input that could be influenced by a user) to construct a file path, ensure the path is valid and safe.  Crucially verify it is not attempting to traverse out of the intended data directory.

#  2. **Use `os.path.abspath` and `os.path.commonpath`:**  Use `os.path.abspath` to get the absolute path of both the base directory for the product data files and the user-provided (or influenced) path.  Then, use `os.path.commonpath` to check if the user-provided path is a subdirectory of the intended base directory.  If `os.path.commonpath` does *not* return the base directory, the path is attempting to traverse outside of the allowed area, and you should reject it.

#Example Implementation of Path Sanitization (If needed for LocalProductService):

#```python
#import os

#def load_data_from_file(filepath, base_data_dir):
#    abs_base_path = os.path.abspath(base_data_dir)
#    abs_file_path = os.path.abspath(filepath)

#    if os.path.commonpath([abs_base_path, abs_file_path]) != abs_base_path:
#        raise ValueError("Invalid filepath: Path traversal attempt detected.")

#    try:
#        with open(abs_file_path, 'r') as f:
#            data = json.load(f)
#            return data
#    except FileNotFoundError:
#        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {filepath}")
#    except json.JSONDecodeError:
#        raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON format in file: {filepath}")

# Then the LocalProductService would use load_data_from_file using a base_data_dir.

#```

# In summary, the core idea is to *never trust* any externally influenced path. Validate it rigorously to prevent attackers from reading arbitrary files or writing to unintended locations.  Since the context does not contain explicit filepath handling, this is provided as an explanation.  If there is no filesystem interaction, there is no immediate path traversal security concern.  If there IS filesystem interaction, this is CRITICAL.
