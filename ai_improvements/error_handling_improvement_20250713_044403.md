    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed with status code {e.response.status_code}: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`**:  This is the core of the improved error handling.  It checks if the HTTP response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). If it does, it raises an `HTTPStatusError`.  This is the standard way to handle HTTP errors in `httpx`.
* **`try...except` block**:  The code that makes the HTTP request is now wrapped in a `try...except` block.  This allows us to catch potential errors during the request.
* **Catching `HTTPStatusError`**: The `except HTTPStatusError as e:` block specifically catches the exception raised by `resp.raise_for_status()`.  It then uses `pytest.fail()` to immediately fail the test, providing a clear error message including the status code and the full error message from `httpx`.
* **Catching other `Exception`**: Added a general `except Exception as e:` block to catch any other unexpected errors that might occur during the request process (e.g., network issues, connection errors).  This prevents the test from silently passing or raising a confusing traceback.
* **`pytest.fail()`**: Instead of just letting an exception propagate, `pytest.fail()` is used.  This explicitly marks the test as failed and provides a descriptive error message.  This makes it much easier to understand why the test failed when looking at the test results.
* **Clear Error Messages**: The error messages now clearly indicate the status code and any other relevant information about the error, making debugging much easier.

This revised code provides robust error handling, ensuring that the test fails gracefully and informatively if there are any issues with the HTTP request.  It specifically addresses the need to check for HTTP errors and provides more general exception handling for unexpected situations.  This is crucial for reliable testing.
