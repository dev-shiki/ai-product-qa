## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a Linter and Formatter:** Integrate a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` into your workflow. This ensures consistent code style across all files, improves readability, and helps catch potential errors early. This saves time on code review and prevents style debates.

2.  **Centralized Configuration:** Abstract configurations (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) into a configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or using environment variables) loaded using a library like `python-dotenv`. This makes deployments and environment management easier.
