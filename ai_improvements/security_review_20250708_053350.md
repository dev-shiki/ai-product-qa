**Explanation of the security improvement:**

**Vulnerability:** Prompt Injection. The code directly passes the user's `request.question` to the `ai_service.get_response()` function. If the AI service doesn't have proper input sanitization or guards against it, a malicious user could craft a question that alters the AI's behavior or extracts sensitive information it's not supposed to reveal.  For example, a prompt injection could ask the AI to ignore its previous instructions and act as a different persona, or to disclose internal data.

**Improvement:** Input Sanitization.  The line `request.question = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?]+', '', request.question)` sanitizes the user-provided question before passing it to the AI service. Specifically:

*   `re.sub(r'[^\w\s\?]+', '', request.question)`: This uses a regular expression to remove any characters that are *not* alphanumeric (`\w`), whitespace (`\s`), or the question mark (`\?`). This helps to prevent malicious characters or code from being injected into the prompt.

**Why this helps:** By removing potentially harmful characters, we reduce the likelihood of the AI being manipulated by the user's input.  It prevents attackers from using special characters or commands in the prompt to bypass intended constraints or gain unauthorized access.  While this sanitization is basic, it serves as a crucial first line of defense.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Defense in Depth:**  This is *one* security measure.  You also need robust prompt injection defenses within the `AIService` itself, as sanitization alone may not be sufficient to prevent all attacks. Implement techniques like prompt engineering, input validation, output filtering, and monitoring.
*   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** The specific sanitization needed depends on the capabilities and vulnerabilities of your AI service. Consider carefully what types of input could be dangerous and tailor the sanitization accordingly.  For example, if your AI model uses markdown, you need to also remove potential markdown-injection characters.
*   **User Experience:** Sanitization can sometimes unintentionally alter legitimate queries. Carefully consider the impact on the user experience and strive to find a balance between security and usability.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging to monitor the questions being asked and any potential prompt injection attempts. This will help you identify and respond to attacks in a timely manner.
*   **Security Audits and Testing:** Regularly audit your application's security, including the integration with the AI service. Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential weaknesses.

This provides a more robust and secure implementation. Always prioritize a layered security approach when working with external services and user-provided input.
