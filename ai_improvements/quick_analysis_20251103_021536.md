## Quick Insights

1. **Improve Project Structure & Modularity:** With 21 Python files, consider refining the `./app` directory structure. Group related modules into sub-packages for better organization and maintainability. For example, create `./app/models`, `./app/services`, etc. This enhances code navigation and clarifies module responsibilities.

2. **Implement Linters & Static Analysis:** Enforce code style consistency and catch potential errors early by integrating linters like `flake8` and static analysis tools like `mypy`. Configure these tools to run automatically during development or in CI/CD pipelines. This improves code quality and reduces the risk of bugs.
