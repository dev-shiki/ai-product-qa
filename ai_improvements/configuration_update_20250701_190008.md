from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

SEARCH_LIMIT = 5  # Extracted configuration value

@pytest.fixture

    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""

        ]

        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", SEARCH_LIMIT)
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", SEARCH_LIMIT)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("test", SEARCH_LIMIT)
        
        assert result == []
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):

```

**Explanation:**

The value `5`, which represents the search limit, was extracted and assigned to a constant variable `SEARCH_LIMIT`. This makes the code more readable and maintainable, as the magic number is replaced with a meaningful name.  Also, if the search limit needs to be changed, it only needs to be modified in one place.  The code was then updated to use `SEARCH_LIMIT` instead of the literal `5` in the relevant tests.  This adheres to the "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
