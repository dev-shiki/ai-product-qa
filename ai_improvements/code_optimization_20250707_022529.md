# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** If this module contains global variables or functions that are only used within the module, make them private by prefixing them with an underscore (`_`).

**Explanation:**  Marking functions or variables as private signals to other developers that they are intended for internal use within the module. This doesn't *strictly* prevent access from outside the module, but it strongly discourages it and improves code clarity by indicating the intended scope of each element.  This aids in refactoring and prevents accidental dependencies on internal implementations. While it doesn't offer a performance boost, it improves maintainability, which is often a valuable "optimization" in the long run.
