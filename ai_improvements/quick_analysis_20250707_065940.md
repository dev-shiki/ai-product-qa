## Quick Insights

Given the project structure, focusing on test coverage and API documentation would yield immediate benefits.

1.  **Increase Test Coverage:** Aim for higher coverage, especially for API endpoints in `products.py`. Use tools like `pytest-cov` to identify untested lines and write more focused unit tests to cover edge cases and ensure API stability.

2.  **Implement API Documentation:** Document the API endpoints using tools like Sphinx or Swagger. This will improve maintainability, allow easier collaboration, and simplify onboarding for new developers. Documenting `products.py`'s API is a priority.
