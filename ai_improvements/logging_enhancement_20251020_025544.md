# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_ai_service.py`  
**Time**: 02:55:44  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Test response"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        logger.info("Calling service.get_response with question: Test question")
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        logger.info(f"Received response: {response}")
        assert response == "Test response"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  Crucially includes the logging module.
* **`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`:** Creates a logger instance specifically for this module (`test_ai_service.py`).  This is the standard and best practice.  Using `__name__` ensures that logs are properly attributed to the correct file, which is essential for debugging in larger projects.
* **`logger.info("Calling service.get_response with question: Test question")`:** Logs a message *before* calling the `get_response` function.  This is important to track the input to the function.
* **`logger.info(f"Received response: {response}")`:** Logs the returned value of `get_response`. This allows you to inspect what the function is returning even if the assertion fails (which can be very helpful in debugging).  The f-string makes it easy to embed the `response` value in the log message.
* **Log level:** I've used `logger.info()`, which is appropriate for general informational messages about the execution of the function. You could use `logger.debug()` for more verbose output, or `logger.warning()`/`logger.error()` if you were logging potentially problematic situations (but those would be more appropriate in the `get_response` function itself when it encounters errors).

This revised answer directly addresses the prompt's request to add logging to *one* function, adds the necessary import and logger initialization, and includes logging statements before and after the function call to provide maximum debugging utility. This makes it much easier to understand the behavior of the function during testing.  The level of detail is appropriate for this example.
