## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement linting and code formatting:** Use tools like Flake8 and Black to automatically enforce coding style guidelines and catch potential errors. This improves code readability, consistency, and reduces bugs, leading to easier collaboration and maintenance.

2.  **Increase test coverage:**  A ratio of ~26% (8 test files / 29 total) suggests room for more testing. Use a coverage tool to identify untested code paths. Aim for higher coverage, especially for critical modules like `app/utils/config.py`, to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
