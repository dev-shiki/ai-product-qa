## Improvement

```python

Data models for the application.
"""
import logging

# Configure logging (basic configuration for simplicity)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def process_data(data: list) -> list:
    """
    Processes a list of data, performing some basic transformations.

    Args:
        data: A list of data elements (assumed to be numerical).

    Returns:
        A new list containing the squares of the input data elements.
    """
    logging.info(f"Entering process_data function with input data: {data}") # Log the function entry and input data

    if not isinstance(data, list):
        logging.error(f"Invalid input: Expected a list, but got {type(data)}") # Log error if the input is not a list
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")

    if not all(isinstance(item, (int, float)) for item in data):
        logging.warning("Input list contains non-numerical values. Attempting to convert.")  # Log warning if non-numerical data found.

        try:
            data = [float(item) for item in data] # Attempt to convert to float if possible
        except ValueError as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to convert non-numerical data: {e}")
            raise ValueError("Input list contains data that cannot be converted to numbers.") from e
    
    squared_data = [x**2 for x in data]  # Calculate the squares of the numbers

    logging.debug(f"Squared data: {squared_data}") # Log the transformed data at DEBUG level

    logging.info("Exiting process_data function.") # Log the function exit

    return squared_data
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Logging Levels:**  Uses `logging.info`, `logging.warning`, `logging.error`, and `logging.debug` appropriately.  This is crucial for filtering logs based on severity.
* **Informative Messages:** The log messages are designed to be helpful when debugging. They clearly indicate what's happening in the function.
* **Data Logging (with Care):**  Logs the input data when entering the function (using `logging.info`).  Critically, logs the *transformed* data using `logging.debug`, which is less verbose.  Avoid logging very large or sensitive data at the `INFO` level.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Includes error handling for invalid input types (not a list) and values (non-numerical that can't be converted).  Logs errors when they occur *and* re-raises the exception, which is generally the correct approach.  The `from e` in `raise ValueError(...) from e` preserves the original exception's traceback, making debugging much easier.
* **Warning for Non-Numerical Data:**  Logs a warning when non-numerical data is encountered but attempts a conversion. This allows the function to be more flexible while still informing the user about potential issues.
* **Log on Function Entry and Exit:** Logs when the function starts and finishes processing, giving a clear view of the function's execution flow.
* **Configuration:** The `logging.basicConfig` line provides a basic logging setup. You'll likely want to customize this more extensively in a real application (e.g., logging to a file, different formats, more sophisticated level handling).
* **Type Hints:** Retains the type hints for clarity.
* **Complete and Executable:** This code is self-contained and runnable.  You can copy and paste it directly into a Python file and test it.

How to use:

```python
# Example usage
# Set logging level to DEBUG to see the 'debug' messages
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')  # Set logging level to see debug

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = process_data(data)
print(f"Result: {result}")

data_with_strings = [1, 2, "3", 4, 5.5]
result2 = process_data(data_with_strings)
print(f"Result with strings: {result2}")


try:
    invalid_data = "not a list"
    process_data(invalid_data)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

This improved answer provides a more robust and practical example of logging, covering important aspects like error handling, different logging levels, and clear message formatting.  Remember to adjust the logging configuration and levels to suit the specific needs of your application.
