**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Improve Code Structure and Modularity:** With 21 files, ensuring clear separation of concerns and well-defined module boundaries is crucial. Review `app/utils/__init__.py` and consider explicit exports using `__all__` to control the public API.  Refactor larger files into smaller, more manageable units to improve readability and maintainability.

2. **Enhance Testing Strategy:** 8 test files against 21 application files might indicate areas where test coverage could be improved.  Investigate code coverage metrics to identify untested code paths.  Prioritize testing core logic and complex modules, especially within `app/utils/config.py` which often handles critical application settings.
