## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to / failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to /health failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This is the core of the improvement.  After making the `GET` request, `response.raise_for_status()` is called.  This method checks the HTTP status code of the response.  If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `httpx.HTTPStatusError` exception.  This is crucial because it explicitly handles cases where the server returns an error, making the test more robust.  Without this, the test might pass even if the server returns a 500 error, leading to false positives.

* **`try...except` Block:**  The code is wrapped in a `try...except` block. This allows us to catch the `HTTPStatusError` that `response.raise_for_status()` might raise. It also catches any other unexpected exception that might occur during the request, ensuring that the test fails gracefully with an informative message.

* **`pytest.fail()`:** Instead of letting the exception bubble up and potentially cause a misleading test failure (or even a test crash), `pytest.fail()` is used.  `pytest.fail()` immediately marks the test as failed and includes a custom error message.  The error message includes the original exception, providing valuable debugging information.  This makes it much easier to understand why the test failed (e.g., "Request to /health failed: 404 Not Found" or "Request to / failed: 500 Internal Server Error").

* **Catching `Exception`:** A broad `except Exception as e` is included as a last resort to catch any other unexpected errors during the request process (e.g., network issues, timeouts, etc.).  This ensures that the test always fails gracefully if something goes wrong.

This improved error handling makes the tests significantly more reliable and easier to debug when they fail.  It addresses the common issue of tests passing incorrectly when the server returns an error.  The use of `pytest.fail()` provides clear and informative error messages, simplifying the debugging process.
