## Improvement

**Optimization:**  Create a fixture for the `AsyncClient` instance.

**Explanation:**

The code repeats the `AsyncClient` setup in both test functions.  Creating a fixture eliminates this redundancy. Fixtures are automatically cleaned up and reused in all test cases which declare it.

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

This reduces code duplication, making the tests more concise and easier to maintain. If changes need to be made to the client setup, you only need to modify the fixture, rather than multiple locations.
