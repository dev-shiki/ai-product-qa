```python

import logging

# Configure logging (adjust level as needed)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def process_data(data):
    """
    Processes some input data.

    Args:
        data:  The data to process (example: a list of numbers).

    Returns:
        The processed data (example: the sum of the numbers).
    """
    logging.info(f"Entering process_data function with data: {data}")  # Log function entry

    try:
        if not isinstance(data, list):
            logging.error(f"Invalid input data type: {type(data)}.  Expected a list.")
            raise TypeError("Input data must be a list.")

        total = sum(data)
        logging.info(f"Calculated total: {total}")  # Log intermediate result

        logging.info(f"Exiting process_data function, returning: {total}")  # Log function exit
        return total

    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"An error occurred during processing: {e}")  # Log the full exception
        raise # Re-raise the exception to propagate it

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example usage with logging
    try:
        result = process_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        print(f"Result: {result}")

        result = process_data("not a list")  # This will trigger the error handling.
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught an error: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  Crucially imports the logging module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(...)`:**  Configures the logging system.  This is *essential* to see any log messages. I've set it to `logging.INFO` level, which means `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages will be displayed. Adjust this level based on the verbosity you need.  The `format` argument specifies the structure of the log messages (timestamp, level, and the message itself).
* **`logging.info(...)`:**  Logs informational messages. Used for normal operation details, like function entry/exit and intermediate results.
* **`logging.error(...)`:**  Logs error messages.  Indicates a problem that the program can handle (e.g., invalid input), but should be investigated.
* **`logging.exception(...)`:**  This is the *most important* part of robust logging.  It logs the full exception information (including the traceback) along with the message.  This gives you the *context* of the error, which is vital for debugging.  `logging.exception` should be used within `except` blocks.
* **`try...except` block:**  This is crucial for catching potential errors during data processing.  Without it, an exception would simply crash the program, and you wouldn't get any helpful information.
* **Re-raising the exception:**  Inside the `except` block, `raise` re-raises the original exception. This is very important.  Logging the exception doesn't mean you've handled it; you still need to allow the calling code to deal with the error. If you don't re-raise, the program will continue as if nothing went wrong, which can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug problems.
* **Example usage with error handling:** The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to call the function and handle potential exceptions. The second call passes invalid data ("not a list"), which triggers the error handling and demonstrates the logging in action.
* **Clear log messages:** The log messages are designed to be informative and provide context.  They include the function name, data being processed, and any relevant results or errors.
* **Correct placement of logging statements:**  The logging statements are strategically placed to capture function entry, intermediate results, and function exit (both normal and exceptional).
* **f-strings:** Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Data: {data}"`) makes it easy to embed variable values directly into the log messages.
* **Type Checking:** The code now explicitly checks if the input `data` is a list and logs an error and raises a `TypeError` if it's not.  This makes the function more robust.
* **Informative Error Message:** When a `TypeError` is raised, the log message now includes the actual type of the data received, making debugging easier.

This revised version provides a much more complete and robust example of logging in Python.  It demonstrates how to handle exceptions gracefully, log relevant information, and provide context for debugging.  Remember to adjust the logging level and format to suit your specific needs.  Run the code, and examine the output to see the log messages in action.  This is crucial for understanding how logging works in practice.
