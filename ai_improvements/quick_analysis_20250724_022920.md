## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider adding a linter (like Flake8 or pylint) and a formatter (like Black).** This will help enforce consistent code style across all files, improve readability, and catch potential errors early on. Integrating these tools into your CI/CD pipeline would automate code quality checks.

2.  **Review the use of `__init__.py` in your `app/models` directory.** If it's empty or solely importing other modules, consider using implicit namespace packages (available from Python 3.3+) to simplify the directory structure. This reduces unnecessary boilerplate.
