**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Enforce Code Style:**  Consider using a linter like `flake8` or `pylint`, along with a formatter like `black`.  This ensures consistent code style across all 21 Python files, improving readability and maintainability. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage:**  While you have 8 test files, assess the actual test coverage using a tool like `coverage.py`. Aim for a high coverage percentage to ensure that most of your code is tested, especially in core modules like `app/models/product.py`.
