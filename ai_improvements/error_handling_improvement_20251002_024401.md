## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            data = response.json()
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert data["status"] == "healthy"
            assert data["version"] == "1.0.0"
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP Error: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Unexpected Error: {e}")
```

Key improvements in `test_health()`:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This is the core of the improved error handling. It checks if the HTTP response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx) and raises an `HTTPStatusError` if it does.  This is much better than just asserting the status code, as it explicitly identifies and handles error responses.
* **`try...except` block:** Encloses the code that might fail within a `try` block.  This allows us to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully.
* **Specific exception handling:**
    *  `HTTPStatusError`: Catches HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) which are common when making API requests.  The `pytest.fail()` function immediately stops the test and reports the error message, providing valuable information about the failure.
    * `Exception as e`: Catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur, providing a generic error message and preventing the test from crashing silently. This ensures that any unexpected issues are reported.
* **`pytest.fail()`:**  Instead of simply letting an `AssertionError` occur, we explicitly use `pytest.fail()`. This provides a clearer, more informative error message within the pytest output, directly indicating where and why the test failed.  Critically, it also allows us to include the original exception message, which is extremely helpful for debugging.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The error messages now include the specific exception that occurred, making it much easier to diagnose the problem.

This revised version provides robust error handling, ensures that test failures are clearly reported, and offers better insights into potential issues with the API endpoint.
