# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/api/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 03:00:32  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging to. I need the code of the function to be able to add logging statements effectively.

For example, if you provide:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y
```

I can return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result: {result}")
  return result
```

**Explanation of the logging added:**

*   **`import logging`:** Imports the `logging` module.
*   **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`:**  Configures basic logging.  `level=logging.INFO` means that log messages with INFO level or higher (e.g., WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be displayed.  You can adjust this as needed.
*   **`logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")`:** Logs an informational message *before* the addition happens, showing the input values.  Uses an f-string for easy variable insertion.
*   **`logging.info(f"Result: {result}")`:** Logs an informational message *after* the addition, showing the result.

**Important Considerations for Choosing Log Levels:**

*   **`logging.DEBUG`:** Detailed information, typically useful only for debugging.
*   **`logging.INFO`:** General information about the program's execution.  Good for tracking progress or significant events.
*   **`logging.WARNING`:** Indicates a potential problem or unexpected situation that doesn't necessarily cause an error.
*   **`logging.ERROR`:** Indicates a serious problem that the program might be able to recover from.
*   **`logging.CRITICAL`:** Indicates a very serious problem that might cause the program to terminate.

**Example with Error Handling:**

If you had a function that could potentially raise an exception, you'd also want to log errors:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def divide(x, y):
  """Divides two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Dividing {x} by {y}")
  try:
    result = x / y
    logging.info(f"Result: {result}")
    return result
  except ZeroDivisionError:
    logging.error("Division by zero!")
    return None  # Or raise the exception if that's more appropriate
```

**In summary, please provide the function you want me to augment with logging statements, and I will tailor the logging to that function's specific behavior and potential issues.**
