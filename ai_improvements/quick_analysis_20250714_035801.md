# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:58:01  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Establish clear module structure:** With 21 files, a flat `app` directory could become unwieldy. Consider further organizing modules into subpackages within `app` (e.g., `app/services`, `app/utils`). This improves maintainability and code navigation.

2. **Prioritize robust testing:**  While 8 test files are a good start, analyze test coverage. Aim for high coverage, especially for critical modules like `app/models/product.py`.  Employ testing frameworks like pytest or unittest with well-defined test suites to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.
