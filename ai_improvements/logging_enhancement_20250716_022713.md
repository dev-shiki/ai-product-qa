# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_queries.py`  
**Time**: 02:27:13  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

# Configure logging (optional, but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.queries.product_service")
async def test_get_brands(mock_service):
    """
    Tests the /api/queries/brands endpoint.  This version includes logging.
    """
    logger.info("Starting test_get_brands")
    mock_service.get_brands.return_value = ["Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"]
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/queries/brands")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
        logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logger.info(f"Response data: {data}")
    assert "brands" in data
    assert set(data["brands"]) >= {"Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"}
    logger.info("test_get_brands passed successfully")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially, the `logging` module is now imported.  Without this, the logging statements would fail.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up a basic logger. This is important so the log messages are actually displayed.  You can adjust the `level` (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.WARNING`, `logging.ERROR`) to control the verbosity of the logging.  If you don't configure it, it often defaults to `WARNING` which means `INFO` and `DEBUG` messages won't be shown.
* **Logger Instance:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance specific to this module.  This is the standard way to create loggers.  Using `__name__` makes it easy to trace log messages back to their origin.
* **Log Statements:**  `logger.info()` statements are added to log the key actions:
    * The start of the test function.
    * Sending the GET request.
    * The response status code.
    * The response data.
    * The success of the test.
* **f-strings:** Uses f-strings (e.g., `f"Response data: {data}"`) for cleaner and more readable logging output. This allows you to easily embed variable values directly into the log messages.
* **Clear Messages:** The log messages are designed to be informative and helpful for debugging.
* **Comprehensive Logging:** The logging covers the key stages of the test, from start to finish, and includes the crucial data being exchanged.
* **No Unnecessary Logging:** The logging isn't overly verbose; it focuses on the essential steps and data.  It's better to have a few well-placed, informative log messages than a flood of useless ones.

This revised response provides a fully functional and properly implemented logging solution for the specified function.  It addresses the core requirements of the prompt and provides a solid foundation for debugging and monitoring your tests.  Remember to adjust the `logging.basicConfig` level and log messages to suit the specific needs of your project.
