```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword}")
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword}")
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword '{keyword}' and limit '{limit}': {str(e)}")
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return await self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
            else:
                return await self.get_all_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting products with limit: {limit}, category: {category}, search: {search}: {str(e)}")
            try:
                return self.local_service.get_products(limit)
            except Exception as fallback_e:
                logger.exception(f"Fallback to local_service.get_products failed: {str(fallback_e)}")
                return []
    
    async def get_categories(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get available categories"""
        try:
            return self.local_service.get_categories()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting categories: {str(e)}")
            return []
... (truncated for analysis)

Key improvements in the `get_products` function's error handling:

1. **`logger.exception` instead of `logger.error`:**  Instead of just logging the error message, `logger.exception` logs the full stack trace.  This is *crucial* for debugging.  Knowing exactly where the error originated is far more helpful than just the message. It's used in all `except` blocks.

2. **Include Context in Log Messages:** The log messages now include the values of `limit`, `category`, and `search` that were used in the failing `get_products` call. This provides valuable context for debugging, making it easier to understand *why* the error occurred. The `search_products` function also has this improved context.

3. **Nested `try-except` for Fallback:** The code now includes a nested `try-except` block for the fallback call to `self.local_service.get_products(limit)`.  If *that* call fails as well, the exception is logged, and an empty list is returned. This prevents a cascade of errors if the fallback mechanism also fails. This is more robust.

4. **`await` before `get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products`:** Added `await` before calling potentially asynchronous methods (`get_products_by_category` and `get_all_products`) to ensure they are properly executed within the asynchronous context.  While the original prompt focused on error handling, this was a necessary correction for correct asynchronous behavior.  It is assumed these functions are either defined as `async def` or are properly wrapped for asynchronous execution.

These changes make the error handling much more robust and provide better information for diagnosing and resolving issues.  The inclusion of stack traces and contextual information in the log messages significantly improves debuggability.  The nested `try-except` protects against failure of the fallback mechanism.
