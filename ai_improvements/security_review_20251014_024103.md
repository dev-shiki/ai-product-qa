## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    health_data = response.json()
    assert health_data["status"] == "healthy"
    assert health_data["version"] == os.getenv("API_VERSION", "1.0.0") # Use environment variable for version
```

**Security Improvement:**

*   **Use Environment Variables for Configuration (specifically `API_VERSION`):**

    *   **Explanation:** Hardcoding the version number ("1.0.0") directly in the test code is a bad practice.  It tightly couples the test to a specific version and makes it difficult to test different versions or configurations without modifying the test code itself.  More importantly, it could expose sensitive information (e.g. version used) if a test error spills it publicly.

    *   Instead, the code now retrieves the API version from an environment variable `API_VERSION` using `os.getenv("API_VERSION", "1.0.0")`.  This means the actual version number can be configured externally (e.g., via a deployment script, Dockerfile, or system environment variables).  The `os.getenv` function provides a default value of "1.0.0" if the environment variable is not set, ensuring the test still runs even if the environment isn't fully configured, but encourages proper configuration.

    *   **Why it's more secure:**
        *   **Separation of Concerns:** Configuration is separated from code, making it easier to manage and update the API version without modifying and potentially breaking the test.
        *   **Flexibility:** The same test code can be used across different environments (development, staging, production) with different API versions by simply setting the environment variable accordingly.
        *   **Sensitive Data Protection:** Avoids hardcoding potentially sensitive information (like precise versions) directly into the codebase, which can be a vulnerability if exposed.  While the version number itself isn't usually highly sensitive, it's a good habit to use environment variables for any configuration that might vary or be considered deployment-specific.

This change promotes a more secure and manageable testing strategy. Using environment variables for configuration is a standard practice in modern application development and deployment.
