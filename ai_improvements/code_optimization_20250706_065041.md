# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:**

*   **Move `product_service = ProductDataService()` outside the router initialization.**

**Explanation:**

Currently, `product_service = ProductDataService()` is defined within the scope of the `router`.  If the module is reloaded this could cause re-instantiations. By defining `product_service = ProductDataService()` outside the scope of the router the instance will persist.
