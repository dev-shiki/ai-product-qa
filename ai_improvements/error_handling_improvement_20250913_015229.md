## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}") # Fail the test with a descriptive message
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` Block:**  Encapsulates the potentially failing `await ac.get("/")` call within a `try...except` block. This is the foundation of robust error handling.
* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This is *crucial*.  `raise_for_status()` is a method of the `httpx.Response` object.  It automatically raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception if the HTTP status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx).  Without this, the test could pass even if the server returns an error like 500, because the response object is still technically created.  This makes the test much more reliable in catching server-side issues.
* **Specific `HTTPStatusError` Handling:** The `except HTTPStatusError as e:` block specifically catches HTTP status errors. This allows you to handle HTTP-specific failures differently (e.g., logging the status code and reason).  The `pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")` part is important because it explicitly *fails the test* and provides a clear error message that includes the details of the HTTP error. This makes debugging much easier.
* **Generic `Exception` Handling:** The `except Exception as e:` block is a catch-all for any other unexpected errors that might occur during the request (e.g., network issues, connection refused, timeouts).  It's important to include this to prevent the test from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.  Again, `pytest.fail` ensures a clear error message in the test results.
* **`pytest.fail()` for Clear Test Failures:**  Instead of just letting an exception bubble up (which might not be immediately obvious as a test failure), `pytest.fail(f"...")` explicitly marks the test as failed. The f-string provides a helpful message with details of the error, making it easy to diagnose.

Why these changes are important:

* **Reliability:** The original code would potentially pass tests even if the server returned an error (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) because it only checked the status code *after* the `get()` call.  `raise_for_status()` ensures that any HTTP error immediately fails the test.
* **Debuggability:** The error messages are much more informative.  Instead of a generic exception, you get the specific HTTP status code and reason phrase, or a description of the underlying network error.
* **Completeness:** The generic `Exception` handler prevents unexpected crashes and ensures that *all* errors are reported as test failures.

This improved version provides a much more robust and reliable way to test your API endpoints, catching errors early and providing clear diagnostic information. I've applied the same error handling improvements to the `test_health` function as well.
