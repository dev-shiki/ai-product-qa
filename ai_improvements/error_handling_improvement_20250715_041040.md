```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`:** This is the core of the improvement.  After making the HTTP request using `ac.get()`, this line checks the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx range), it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception.  This is the standard way to handle HTTP errors when using `httpx`.

* **`try...except` block:** The code is now wrapped in a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during the HTTP request:
    * **`HTTPStatusError`:**  Specifically catches errors resulting from bad HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error). This allows you to handle expected HTTP errors gracefully.
    * **`Exception as e`:** Catches any *other* unexpected exceptions that might occur during the request.  This is important because things like network errors, connection timeouts, or errors in the application code *could* also cause the test to fail unexpectedly.

* **`pytest.fail(f"...")`:**  Instead of simply letting the test crash (which would happen if an unhandled exception occurred), the `pytest.fail()` function is used to explicitly mark the test as failed. The `f"..."` string provides a descriptive error message explaining *why* the test failed, making debugging much easier.  The error message includes the original exception that caused the failure.

* **Specific handling of 404 in `test_get_product_by_id_not_found`:** This is very important.  The previous version wouldn't properly handle the expected 404. Now, the `except HTTPStatusError` block in `test_get_product_by_id_not_found` *asserts* that the `resp.status_code` is 404.  This confirms that the test is actually verifying the correct behavior when a product ID is not found.  If the server returned a different error (e.g., 500), the test would fail, which is the correct behavior.

This revised code provides significantly better error handling, making the tests more robust and easier to debug. It covers common HTTP error scenarios and also catches unexpected exceptions, providing informative failure messages.  Critically, it now correctly verifies the expected 404 response in the `test_get_product_by_id_not_found` test.
