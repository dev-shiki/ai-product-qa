import os  # Import the os module

# Configuration
#API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000" # Hardcoded URL - BAD
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")  # Get from environment variable

**Security Improvement:**

*   **Use Environment Variables for Configuration:**  Instead of hardcoding the `API_BASE_URL` directly in the code, retrieve it from an environment variable (`os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`).

**Explanation:**

*   **Problem:** Hardcoding sensitive configuration data (like API URLs, database credentials, API keys) directly in the source code is a major security risk.  If the code is ever committed to a public repository (even accidentally), or if an attacker gains access to the codebase, they immediately have access to that critical information.

*   **Solution:**  Environment variables provide a way to configure applications externally.  They are typically stored outside of the code repository and can be set on the server or system where the application is running.

*   **How it works:**
    *   `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`: This attempts to read the value of the environment variable named `API_BASE_URL`.
    *   If the environment variable is set, its value is used as the `API_BASE_URL`.
    *   If the environment variable is *not* set, the second argument `"http://localhost:8000"` acts as a *default* value.  This is important for local development or situations where the environment variable might not be explicitly set.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Security:** Prevents sensitive information from being exposed in the code repository.
    *   **Flexibility:**  Allows you to easily change the configuration of the application without modifying the code.  You can deploy the same code to different environments (development, staging, production) and configure it differently in each environment simply by setting different environment variables.
    *   **Best Practice:** Using environment variables for configuration is a widely accepted and recommended practice for building secure and maintainable applications.

**How to use it:**

1.  **Set the environment variable:**  How you set environment variables depends on your operating system and deployment environment.
    *   **Linux/macOS:**  In your terminal, you might use a command like:
        ```bash
        export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"
        ```
        You might also set it in a `.env` file and load it using a library like `python-dotenv`.

    *   **Windows:** You can set environment variables through the System Properties dialog.

    *   **Deployment Platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud):** Each platform provides a specific way to set environment variables for your application.

2.  **Run your Streamlit app:** When your Streamlit app runs, it will automatically read the `API_BASE_URL` from the environment variable.

This single change significantly improves the security of your Streamlit application.
