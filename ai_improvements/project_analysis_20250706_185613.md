## Improvement

**Optimization:** Add a docstring explaining the purpose of the module.

**Improved Code:**

```python
"""
Service modules for the application.
This module contains functions and classes that handle business logic 
and data processing, separating it from the presentation layer.
"""
```

**Explanation:**

While not a performance optimization in the traditional sense, adding a clear docstring is a crucial optimization for code maintainability and readability. It allows developers (including your future self) to quickly understand the module's role within the application, making it easier to navigate, debug, and extend the code later. This will lead to less time spent trying to figure out the purpose of the module and quicker more effective development cycles. This can often be MORE important than micro-optimizations that save milliseconds.
