## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions based on your project structure:

1.  **Enforce consistent code style:** With 21 Python files, using a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black`) can greatly improve code readability and consistency across the project. Automate these checks with pre-commit hooks to catch issues early.

2.  **Review test coverage:** Ensure your 8 test files provide adequate coverage of core functionalities, especially within the `./app/api/` directory. Use a coverage tool (like `coverage.py`) to identify untested code paths and prioritize adding tests for critical components.
