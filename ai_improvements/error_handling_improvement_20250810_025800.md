# Error Handling Improvement

## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
    assert "Invalid API Key" in str(excinfo.value)
```

**Reasoning for Improvement:**

The original code for `test_settings_invalid` only checked if a `ValueError` was raised. While this confirms that the invalid key caused an error, it doesn't verify *why* the `ValueError` was raised. This makes debugging and understanding the root cause of failures harder.

The improved code adds an `assert` statement within the `with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:` block. This statement checks if the string "Invalid API Key" is present in the error message raised by the `config.Settings` constructor.

**Benefits:**

*   **Specific Error Verification:** The code now explicitly verifies that the `ValueError` is raised because of an invalid API key, not some other unrelated issue.
*   **Improved Debugging:** If the test fails, the error message will indicate that the `ValueError` was not due to the expected reason ("Invalid API Key" not found). This gives developers a more precise indication of what went wrong.
*   **More Robust Test:** The test is now more resistant to accidental changes in the `config.Settings` class that might raise a `ValueError` for reasons other than an invalid API key.  The test will only pass if the expected error message is raised, making it a more reliable indicator of correct functionality.
*   **Clearer Intent:** The added `assert` makes the intent of the test clearer: to ensure that the `Settings` class raises a `ValueError` with a specific message when given an invalid API key.

This improvement adds a layer of robustness and clarity to the test suite, making it more valuable for maintaining the quality of the `app.utils.config` module.
