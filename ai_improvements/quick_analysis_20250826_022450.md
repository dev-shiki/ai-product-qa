# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:24:50  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Enforce consistent code style:** With 21 Python files, using a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` along with a formatter like `black` will improve readability and maintainability. Integrate these into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.

2. **Increase test coverage:** Only 8 test files for 21 source files likely means insufficient test coverage. Target 80% or higher coverage. Focus on testing critical logic in modules like `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`, prioritizing edge cases and boundary conditions.
