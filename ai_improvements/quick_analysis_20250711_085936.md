# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 08:59:36  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1. **Implement a comprehensive test suite:** Having 8 test files for 21 Python files is a start, but ensure sufficient test coverage. Aim for a higher percentage of code coverage (e.g., >80%) by using a coverage tool. Focus on testing critical functions and edge cases in `products.py` and other API endpoints.

2. **Enforce consistent code style with a linter and formatter:** Integrate tools like `flake8` and `black` to automatically check and format code. This improves readability, maintainability, and reduces stylistic disagreements. Add these to your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
