## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def async_client():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root(async_client: AsyncClient):
    response = await async_client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health(async_client: AsyncClient):
    response = await async_client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Justification:**

The original code creates a new `AsyncClient` instance for each test function (`test_root` and `test_health`).  Creating the `AsyncClient` involves initializing the ASGI transport and potentially establishing connections, which can add overhead.

The suggested improvement uses a `pytest.fixture` with `scope="module"` to create a single `AsyncClient` instance that is shared across all tests within the module. This means the `AsyncClient` and its underlying connection are only created once, significantly reducing the overhead of setting up the testing environment for each individual test.  `async_client` fixture is injected as a parameter to each test function that needs it.  This pattern of using fixtures for shared resources is a best practice in pytest for improving performance and reducing code duplication.  The `yield` keyword in the fixture ensures that the client is properly closed down when all tests in the module have finished.
