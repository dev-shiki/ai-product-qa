## Improvement

```python
import logging
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

# Configure logging (you might want to configure this globally in your application)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def test_product_specifications():
    logger.info("Starting test_product_specifications")
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    logger.debug(f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5, "Rating assertion failed"
    logger.debug("Rating assertion passed")
    assert spec.sold == 100, "Sold assertion failed"
    logger.debug("Sold assertion passed")
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta", "Shop location assertion failed"
    logger.debug("Shop location assertion passed")
    assert spec.color == "Hitam", "Color assertion failed"
    logger.debug("Color assertion passed")
    logger.info("Finished test_product_specifications")

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially imports the `logging` module.
* **Logger Instance:** Creates a logger instance `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.  Using `__name__` is best practice because it will show the module where the log message originated.
* **Basic Configuration:**  Includes `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`. This is *essential* to make the logging statements actually appear in the output.  Without this, they will be silently ignored.  `level=logging.DEBUG` sets the lowest level of message that will be displayed (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).  You'll likely want a more sophisticated configuration in a real application, but this makes the example self-contained.  The configuration should ideally be done once for the entire application, not repeatedly in each function.
* **`logger.info` for start and end:**  Uses `logger.info` to log the start and end of the function, providing a clear indication of the function's execution flow.
* **`logger.debug` for variable values and assertions:** Uses `logger.debug` to log the created object (`spec`) and the results of assertions.  `logger.debug` is more appropriate for detailed information that you don't always need to see (only when debugging). The f-string formatting `f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}"`  allows you to easily include variable values in the log message. This provides valuable context for debugging.
* **Assertion Messages:** Added helpful assertion messages `assert spec.rating == 4.5, "Rating assertion failed"`.  This makes it much easier to diagnose *why* an assertion failed.
* **Error Handling (Implicit):**  If an assertion fails, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`, which will be caught by the testing framework (e.g., pytest).  While this isn't explicit error *handling*, it *is* a critical part of the testing process, and the log messages will help pinpoint the source of the error.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Uses consistent formatting and clear log messages.
* **No unnecessary logging:**  Avoids logging *everything*. Focuses on key events and variable values.

How to run this with logging:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_product.py`).  Make sure your `app` directory structure is in place.
2.  **Run with pytest:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_product.py`, and run `pytest -s test_product.py`. The `-s` option is important; it tells pytest *not* to capture standard output, which means you'll see the logging messages printed to the console.  If you don't use `-s`, pytest will capture the output and only show it if a test fails.

You should see output similar to this (assuming all assertions pass):

```
============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.11.5, pytest-7.4.3, pluggy-1.3.0

test_product.py::test_product_response PASSED                         [100%]

============================== 3 passed in 0.01s ==============================
```

And interleaved with the test results, you'll see the logging output:

```
INFO:__main__:Starting test_product_specifications
DEBUG:__main__:Created ProductSpecifications object: ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition='Baru', shop_location='Jakarta', shop_name='Toko A', storage='128GB', color='Hitam', warranty='1 tahun')
DEBUG:__main__:Rating assertion passed
DEBUG:__main__:Sold assertion passed
DEBUG:__main__:Shop location assertion passed
DEBUG:__main__:Color assertion passed
INFO:__main__:Finished test_product_specifications
... (other test output)
```

If an assertion fails, you'll see the traceback and the "AssertionError: ..." message, along with the preceding logging messages, which will help you understand the state of the program just before the failure.
