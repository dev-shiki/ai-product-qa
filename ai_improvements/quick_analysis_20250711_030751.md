## Quick Insights

Given the file structure, focusing on organization and testing are key.

1.  **Package Structure Clarity:**  Review `app/api/__init__.py`. Ensure it clearly defines the API package's interface. Explicitly import necessary modules/functions from `products.py` (e.g., `from .products import get_products, ...`) to prevent implicit imports and improve discoverability.

2.  **Test Organization:** Assess the test file structure. Are tests grouped by functionality or module? Consider mirroring your `app` directory structure with a `tests` directory (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py`) to improve test discoverability and maintainability.
