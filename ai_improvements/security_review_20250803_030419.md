**Explanation:**

The security improvement is replacing the hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` with an environment variable.

*   **Problem:** Hardcoding the API base URL directly in the script is a security risk. If the application is deployed to different environments (development, staging, production), the URL might need to change.  If it's hardcoded, someone needs to edit the code and redeploy, which is error-prone.  More importantly, if the code is ever committed to a public repository (even accidentally), the API base URL is exposed, potentially allowing unauthorized access if the API is not properly secured itself.

*   **Solution:**  Using `os.getenv("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")` addresses this:
    *   `os.getenv("API_BASE_URL")`: This attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable named `API_BASE_URL`.
    *   `"http://localhost:8000"`: This is the *default value*. If the environment variable `API_BASE_URL` is not set, the code will fall back to using `http://localhost:8000`.  This is good for local development, where the environment variable might not be configured.

*   **How it improves security:**
    *   **Configuration Flexibility:** The API base URL can be easily changed in different environments *without* modifying the code. You can set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable on the server where the application is deployed.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Environment variables are a standard way to manage configuration and secrets.  They are often handled by deployment tools or orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes) that provide mechanisms for securely storing and injecting environment variables into the application's runtime environment.  This prevents sensitive information like API keys or URLs from being directly embedded in the codebase.
    *   **Prevent accidental exposure:** It's less likely that the API URL will be exposed in a public repository if it's not part of the source code.
    *   **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps the configuration separate from the code.

**To use this:**

1.  **Set the environment variable:** Before running the script, set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable.  How you do this depends on your operating system and deployment environment:

    *   **Linux/macOS:** `export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"`
    *   **Windows:** `set API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"`

    In a production environment, use your deployment platform's mechanism for setting environment variables (e.g., Docker Compose `environment:` section, Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, cloud provider configuration settings).

2.  **Run the script:**  When the script runs, it will now use the API base URL from the environment variable (if set) or the default value (if not set).
