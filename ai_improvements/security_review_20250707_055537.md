Explanation of Improvement:

The primary security improvement implemented is **API Key Encryption with Password-Based Key Derivation**.

1.  **Problem:** Hardcoding API keys or storing them in plaintext within the service modules presents a significant security risk.  If the code repository is compromised, the API keys are immediately exposed.

2.  **Solution:**
    *   **Encryption:** The `encrypt_api_key` and `decrypt_api_key` functions encrypt the API key using the `cryptography` library. This makes the API key unreadable without the correct decryption key.
    *   **Password-Based Key Derivation (PBKDF2HMAC):**  Instead of directly using a user-provided password as the encryption key (which is highly insecure), we use PBKDF2HMAC (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 with HMAC-SHA256). PBKDF2HMAC derives a strong, cryptographically secure key from the user's password and a randomly generated *salt*.
    *   **Salt:**  A unique, randomly generated salt is used for each API key encryption.  Salting prevents attackers from using precomputed tables of password hashes (rainbow tables) to crack the encryption.  The salt is stored alongside the encrypted API key (separated by a colon).
    *   **Iterations:** The `iterations` parameter in PBKDF2HMAC controls the computational cost of key derivation.  A higher number of iterations makes it more difficult for attackers to brute-force the password. The code uses `480000` iterations, which is a reasonably secure value but should be increased as computing power increases.
    *   **Fernet:** Fernet is a symmetric encryption scheme that guarantees that a message encrypted using it cannot be manipulated or read without the key.
    *   **Secure Key Storage (Critical):**  **Crucially, the example code gets the encryption password from an environment variable (os.environ.get("API_KEY_PASSWORD")).  This is a much better approach than hardcoding the password in the code.** The best practice is to store the password in a secure secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) and retrieve it at runtime.  **Never hardcode the password directly into the code.**  If someone gains access to the code, they instantly have the means to decrypt the API keys.
    *   **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks in decryption to handle potential errors and log them. This prevents the service from crashing and provides valuable information for debugging.
    *   **Logging:** Uses `logging` module for better error tracking and debugging.
    *   **Salt Storage:** The code now stores and retrieves the salt associated with each encrypted API key.  This is essential for proper decryption.

3.  **Benefits:**
    *   **Increased Security:**  Even if the code repository is compromised, the API keys are protected by encryption.
    *   **Password-Based:** The encryption key is derived from a password, adding an extra layer of security.
    *   **Salting:**  The use of salts makes it more difficult for attackers to crack the encryption.
    *   **Best Practices:** The code follows best practices for key management by storing the encryption key securely (environment variable, ideally a secrets manager).

4.  **How to use:**
    *   Set a strong password in an environment variable named `API_KEY_PASSWORD`.
    *   Use the `encrypt_api_key` function to encrypt your API key.
    *   Store the encrypted API key (along with the salt) in a secure location (e.g., a database, configuration file).
    *   Use the `decrypt_api_key` function to decrypt the API key when needed.

This improved code significantly enhances the security of the service modules by protecting the API keys from unauthorized access.  Remember to implement strong password management and secure key storage practices to maximize the effectiveness of the encryption.  Also, consider rotating API keys regularly as an additional security measure.
