## Quick Insights

Given a small project with 21 Python files and 8 test files, consider these improvements:

1.  **Establish Consistent Formatting:** Use a tool like Black and enforce it with a pre-commit hook. This ensures consistent code style across all files, improving readability and maintainability, especially with multiple contributors.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage & Structure:** 8 test files for 21 source files suggest potential coverage gaps. Analyze coverage reports to identify untested areas. Refactor test files to use fixtures for setup and teardown, promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for cleaner, more maintainable tests.
