## Improvement

```python
import logging
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

# Configure logging (you might want to do this at a higher level, e.g., in a main module)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def test_product_specifications():
    logger.debug("Starting test_product_specifications")
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    logger.debug(f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5
    logger.debug(f"Assertion passed: spec.rating == 4.5")
    assert spec.sold == 100
    logger.debug(f"Assertion passed: spec.sold == 100")
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    logger.debug(f"Assertion passed: spec.shop_location == 'Jakarta'")
    assert spec.color == "Hitam"
    logger.debug(f"Assertion passed: spec.color == 'Hitam'")
    logger.debug("Finished test_product_specifications")


def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  This is essential to use the logging module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`:**  Critically important! This sets up the basic logging configuration.  `level=logging.DEBUG` means you'll see all log messages (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). You can adjust the level to control verbosity.  Best practice is to do this at the application entry point, not within individual test functions.  I've added it at the module level for simplicity.
* **`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`:** Creates a logger instance specific to this module. This helps you track where log messages originate from. Using `__name__` is a standard practice.
* **`logger.debug("Starting test_product_specifications")`:**  A DEBUG level message indicating the function's start.
* **`logger.debug(f"Created ProductSpecifications object: {spec}")`:** Logs the created object.  Crucially, this uses an f-string to include the *value* of the `spec` variable in the log message.  Without this, you'd just log the string "spec".  Logging the object's representation (`__repr__` or `__str__` methods) is incredibly useful for debugging.
* **`logger.debug(f"Assertion passed: spec.rating == 4.5")`:** Logs after each assertion, indicating whether the assertion passed.  This can be very helpful for pinpointing failures.
* **`logger.debug("Finished test_product_specifications")`:**  A DEBUG level message indicating the function's completion.
* **Choosing the Right Logging Level:**  I used `logger.debug` for all the log messages here because they are primarily useful for debugging purposes.  If you had information that was more generally useful, you might use `logger.info`.  `logger.warning`, `logger.error`, and `logger.critical` are for more serious issues.

This revised solution provides a much more robust and informative logging system for your test function.  Remember to adjust the logging level and format based on your specific needs. Also, ensure that the `logging.basicConfig` is done *once* at the start of your application, not repeatedly in each function or test.
