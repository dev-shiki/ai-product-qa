**Explanation:**

The suggested security improvement is to sanitize the input `request.question` before passing it to the `ai_service.get_response()` function.  This is crucial to prevent **prompt injection attacks**.

**Prompt injection** occurs when a user crafts an input (in this case, the question) that manipulates the behavior of the AI model. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as:

*   **Exfiltrating sensitive data:** The attacker could ask the AI to reveal information it is not supposed to disclose.
*   **Bypassing security restrictions:** The attacker could trick the AI into performing actions it is normally restricted from doing.
*   **Causing denial of service:** The attacker could craft a question that causes the AI to consume excessive resources.

**Why the added code helps:**

The line `request.question = re.sub(r'[<>"\'%;(){}]', '', request.question)` uses a regular expression to remove potentially harmful characters from the user's input. Let's break it down:

*   `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`: This is the regular expression substitution function in Python. It finds all occurrences of the `pattern` in the `string` and replaces them with the `replacement`.
*   `r'[<>"\'%;(){}]'`: This is the regular expression pattern.
    *   `r'...'`:  The `r` prefix indicates a raw string, preventing backslashes from being interpreted as escape sequences.
    *   `[...]`:  This defines a character class. Any character within the square brackets will be matched.
    *   `<>"\'%;(){}`: These are the specific characters being targeted.  These characters are often used in code injection and can be exploited.  For example:
        *   `<>`: Often used in HTML injection
        *   `"'`: Used in SQL injection, code injection, or escaping strings.
        *   `%;(){}`: Can cause issues if passed into a templating engine or other execution context.
*   `''`: This is the replacement string.  It replaces any matched characters with an empty string, effectively removing them.
*   `request.question`: The string to be sanitized.

**How it mitigates prompt injection:**

By removing potentially harmful characters, the sanitization reduces the likelihood that the user's input can be used to manipulate the AI model in unintended ways. It limits the attack surface by stripping out common characters that adversaries use to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context-Specific Sanitization:** The best sanitization strategy depends on the specific AI model and how the question is used. This regular expression is a general starting point, but you might need to add or remove characters based on your specific requirements.
*   **Output Encoding:** Always ensure that any data outputted by the AI is properly encoded to prevent further injection attacks (e.g., HTML encoding if the output is displayed in a web page).
*   **Defense in Depth:** Sanitization should be part of a broader defense-in-depth strategy, which includes input validation, rate limiting, and other security measures.
*   **Limitations**:  This sanitization approach doesn't prevent ALL prompt injection attacks.  More sophisticated attacks are still possible (e.g. using natural language to subtly manipulate the AI). For more robust prompt injection protection, consider using more advanced techniques like prompt hardening, input validation schemes specific to your AI model, or guardrails.
*   **AI Service Configuration**: Ensure that the AIService itself is configured with security best practices in mind, e.g. restricting the model's access to external resources or sensitive information.

This change provides a simple but effective first step in protecting against prompt injection vulnerabilities.  It should be integrated into a more comprehensive security strategy.
