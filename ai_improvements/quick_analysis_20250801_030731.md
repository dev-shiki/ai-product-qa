## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions:

1. **Implement a Linter and Formatter:**  Introduce a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black` with pre-commit hooks. This will ensure consistent code style across the project, catch potential errors early, and improve readability. Consistent code is easier to maintain and collaborate on.

2. **Improve Test Coverage Reporting:** Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to generate coverage reports. This helps identify areas of the code that are not adequately tested.  Aim for a reasonable coverage percentage (e.g., 80%+) to build confidence in your codebase.
