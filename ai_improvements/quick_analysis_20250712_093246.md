## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1. **Improve code organization:** With 21 Python files, consider more structured packaging.  For example, group related functionality within sub-packages inside the `app` directory.  This enhances maintainability and makes navigating the codebase easier. Look for natural groupings based on functionality.

2. **Enhance Testing:**  Aim for higher test coverage.  Ensure that core modules and complex logic within `product.py` and similar modules are adequately tested.  Consider using tools like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage and identify areas needing more tests.
