**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralize Configuration:**  Move environment-specific settings from scattered files (likely within the 21 Python files) to a single configuration file (e.g., using `configparser` or `python-decouple`).  This improves maintainability and deployment.

2. **Consider API Layer Structure:**  With `queries.py` and `products.py`, it seems you're building an API.  Explore using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.  This provides structure for routing, request handling, and error management, replacing ad-hoc solutions that might exist currently.
