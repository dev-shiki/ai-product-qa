## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os  # Import the os module

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Read allowed origins from environment variable (or provide a default)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "")
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR else []

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,  # Use the configured origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Improvement:**

The primary security improvement is replacing the wildcard `"*"` in `allow_origins` with a list of explicitly allowed origins read from an environment variable. This addresses a significant vulnerability:

**Problem:**

*   `allow_origins=["*"]` in `CORSMiddleware` effectively disables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protection. Any website, regardless of its origin, can make requests to your API.  This opens up the possibility of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and other malicious exploits, as untrusted origins can interact with your API on behalf of users.

**Solution:**

1.  **Environment Variable:** We introduce an environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Environment variables are a standard and secure way to configure applications, especially in production environments.  They allow you to change the configuration without modifying the code.

2.  **Reading Origins:**  The code now reads the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:
    *   `os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "")`:  This retrieves the value of the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to an empty string `""`.
    *   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR else []`: This splits the string from the environment variable into a list of origins, using the comma as a delimiter.  If the string is empty (meaning the environment variable wasn't set), it defaults to an empty list.

3.  **Setting `allow_origins`:**  The `allow_origins` parameter of `CORSMiddleware` is now set to the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list.

**How to use it:**

1.  **Set the Environment Variable:** Before running your application, set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.  For example, in Linux/macOS:

    ```bash
    export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://www.example.com,https://www.another-domain.com"
    ```

    In Windows:

    ```bash
    set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://www.example.com,https://www.another-domain.com"
    ```

    Or set it using your deployment platform's (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku) environment variable configuration.

2.  **Run the Application:** Start your FastAPI application.  It will now only accept requests from the origins specified in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.

**Why this is better:**

*   **Security:** Significantly reduces the risk of CSRF and other cross-origin attacks by explicitly allowing only trusted domains.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows you to easily change the allowed origins without modifying the code.  This is especially important in different environments (development, staging, production).
*   **Best Practice:** Using environment variables for configuration is a widely accepted best practice in modern software development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Carefully Curate Allowed Origins:**  Only add origins that you trust.  Be very cautious about adding origins you don't control.
*   **Subdomains:** Remember to explicitly include subdomains if you want them to be allowed (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).
*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS for your API and ensure that the allowed origins use HTTPS as well to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Consider a more advanced CORS configuration:** For finer-grained control, you might want to dynamically determine the allowed origin based on the `Origin` header of the request.  However, the solution provided here is a good starting point and addresses the most critical vulnerability.  Consider using a framework-specific CORS library for more advanced configuration options.

This approach provides a much more secure and manageable CORS configuration.  It's crucial to properly configure and maintain the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.
