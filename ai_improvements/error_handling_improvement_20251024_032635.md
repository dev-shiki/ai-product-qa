```python

    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)

Key improvements:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`:**  This is the core improvement.  It checks if the HTTP response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). If it does, it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception, which is then caught.  This is much better than just checking `resp.status_code == 200` because it explicitly handles error responses from the API.  Without this, a 500 error would silently pass, leading to misleading test results.
* **`try...except` block:** Encloses the `ac.get()` call and `resp.raise_for_status()` call in a `try...except` block. This allows us to catch potential exceptions during the HTTP request, such as network errors, server errors, or any other unexpected issues.  Two `except` blocks are used:
    * **`HTTPStatusError`**: This catches HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx status codes) raised by `resp.raise_for_status()`.
    * **`Exception`**: This is a general exception handler that catches any other unexpected errors during the HTTP request process.  This prevents the test from crashing and provides a more informative error message.
* **`pytest.fail()`:**  Instead of just letting the test fail implicitly, `pytest.fail()` explicitly marks the test as failed with a custom error message. This makes debugging much easier because you know exactly why the test failed.  The error message includes the details of the exception that occurred.

This revised code provides significantly better error handling for the HTTP requests in the test, making it more robust and reliable.  It avoids silent failures and provides more informative error messages, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues with the API or the test itself.
