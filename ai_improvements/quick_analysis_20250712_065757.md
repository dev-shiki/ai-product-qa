## Quick Insights

Given the size, consider these quick improvements:

1.  **Code Style and Linting:** Implement a consistent code style using a tool like Black and enforce it with a linter like Flake8 (integrated into pre-commit hooks). This increases readability and reduces stylistic inconsistencies across the 21 files.

2.  **Test Coverage Measurement:** Implement a test coverage tool like Coverage.py. This will help you understand which parts of your application are not adequately tested by your 8 test files. Identifying and filling coverage gaps improves reliability.
