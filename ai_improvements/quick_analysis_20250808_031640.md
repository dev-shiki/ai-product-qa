# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 03:16:40  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Improve Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 source files, the ratio suggests potentially low test coverage. Focus on increasing coverage of critical components, especially within `app/models`, to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.

2.  **Enforce Consistent Style:** Implement a code linter (like flake8 or pylint) and a formatter (like black) to maintain consistent code style across all files. This enhances readability, reduces potential errors, and facilitates collaboration. Consider integrating this into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.
