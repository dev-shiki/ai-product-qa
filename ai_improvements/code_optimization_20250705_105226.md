## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Change `ProductResponse.specifications: Dict` to `ProductResponse.specifications: ProductSpecifications`

**Explanation:**

Using `ProductSpecifications` instead of `Dict` for the `specifications` field in `ProductResponse` enforces type checking and validation on the specifications data.  This ensures that the specifications conform to the defined `ProductSpecifications` model, improving data integrity and preventing unexpected errors. While it might not offer a *massive* speed boost, it improves code reliability and maintainability, which is often more important than micro-optimizations.  It also gives you the benefit of automatic data validation and serialization from the `ProductSpecifications` class.
