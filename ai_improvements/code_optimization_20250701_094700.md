# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Optimization:** Memoize API responses to avoid redundant calls.

**Improvement:** Use `st.cache_data` to cache the results of API calls.

**Explanation:**

The code likely makes API calls to `API_BASE_URL`.  If the same request is made multiple times during a session, re-fetching the data each time is inefficient.  `st.cache_data` (formerly `st.cache`) is a decorator that caches the output of a function based on its inputs.  If the function is called with the same inputs again, Streamlit will serve the cached result instead of re-executing the function.  This drastically reduces latency and server load, especially if API calls are expensive.

**Example (assuming a function `fetch_product_data` makes the API call):**

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import time

# Configuration
API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

@st.cache_data
def fetch_product_data(product_id):
    """Fetches product data from the API."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/products/{product_id}")  #Example API Call
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        st.error(f"Error fetching product data: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    # ... (rest of your code)

    product_id = 123  # Example product ID
    product_data = fetch_product_data(product_id)

    if product_data:
        st.write(product_data) # Example use of the cached data

    # ... (rest of your code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By adding `@st.cache_data` to `fetch_product_data`, the API call is only made once for each `product_id` during a session. Subsequent calls with the same `product_id` will retrieve the data from the cache.  This is a simple but highly effective optimization.  Make sure to name your function arguments so that Streamlit can properly determine if cached data exists.  Also note the use of `response.raise_for_status()` to handle potential API errors gracefully.
