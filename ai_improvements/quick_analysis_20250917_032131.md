## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider using a linter and formatter:** Tools like `flake8` and `black` can enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early on. This will improve readability and maintainability across your 21 Python files. Integrate them into your development workflow.

2.  **Analyze test coverage:**  With 8 test files for 21 source files, it's worth checking your test coverage using a tool like `coverage.py`. Identify areas with low coverage to write more targeted tests, ensuring the reliability of your application logic, particularly within the `./app/utils` package.
