# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:42:54  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Consider using a linter and formatter (like Black and Flake8):**  This helps enforce consistent code style across all files, improving readability and reducing potential errors.  Easily integrate these into your workflow for automatic checks.

2. **Analyze test coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 code files, there might be insufficient test coverage.  Tools like `coverage.py` can highlight which lines of code aren't being tested, helping prioritize writing more comprehensive tests, especially around core logic in `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`.
