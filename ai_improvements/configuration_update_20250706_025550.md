# Configuration Update

**File**: `./tests/test_main.py`  
**Time**: 02:55:50  
**Type**: configuration_update

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

# Configuration value extracted
BASE_URL = "http://test"
API_VERSION = "1.0.0"


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app

    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url=BASE_URL) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app

    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url=BASE_URL) as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == API_VERSION
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **`BASE_URL = "http://test"`:**  The base URL `"http://test"` is extracted and assigned to a constant `BASE_URL`.  This makes the code more readable and maintainable.  If you need to change the base URL, you only need to change it in one place.

2. **`API_VERSION = "1.0.0"`:** Similarly, the API version string is extracted into the `API_VERSION` constant.

3. **Replaced inline values with constants:** The string literals within the `AsyncClient` calls and the `assert` statement are replaced with the respective constants.  This reduces redundancy and improves clarity.

**Why this is better:**

* **Readability:**  The code is easier to understand because the purpose of the string `"http://test"` and `"1.0.0"` is clear.
* **Maintainability:** If you need to change the base URL (e.g., to "http://localhost:8000" for local testing), you only need to change it in one place.  This reduces the risk of errors.
* **Reusability:**  The `BASE_URL` constant can be reused in other tests or parts of the application.
* **Testability:**  Using constants makes it easier to parameterize tests and run them with different configurations.
