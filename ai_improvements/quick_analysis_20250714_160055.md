# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 16:00:55  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure (21 Python files, 8 test files, and an `app` directory with `main.py` and a `models` subdirectory), here are two quick suggestions:

1.  **Establish Clear API Contracts:** Document API endpoints with tools like Swagger or FastAPI.  This improves maintainability and collaboration, as the project grows.

2.  **Enforce Consistent Code Style:**  Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` to automatically enforce coding style rules. This will improve code readability and reduce stylistic debates.
