# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 10:55:48  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:**  Instead of hardcoding settings (API keys, database URLs) across 21 files, implement a configuration system (e.g., using `python-decouple` or environment variables). This makes deployments and environment-specific adjustments much easier.

2. **Test Discovery and Coverage:** Ensure your 8 test files cover critical functionality.  Use a test runner like `pytest` with coverage reporting (`pytest-cov`) to identify untested code paths and improve overall test quality.  Automate this in your CI/CD pipeline.
