## Improvement

```python
"""
Service modules for the application.
"""
import logging

# Configure logging (if not already configured elsewhere)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def my_important_function(arg1, arg2):
    """
    This is a very important function that does something critical.

    Args:
        arg1: The first argument.
        arg2: The second argument.

    Returns:
        The result of the important operation.  Returns None if an error occurs.
    """
    logging.info(f"my_important_function called with arg1={arg1}, arg2={arg2}")

    try:
        # Simulate some important operation
        if arg2 == 0:  # Simulate an error condition
            raise ValueError("arg2 cannot be zero")
        result = arg1 / arg2
        logging.debug(f"Calculated result: {result}")  # Debug level - only shows in debug mode
        logging.info(f"my_important_function completed successfully with result={result}")
        return result
    except ValueError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error in my_important_function: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"Unexpected error in my_important_function: {e}") #log the full stack trace
        return None
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Logging Statements:**  Includes `logging.info`, `logging.debug`, `logging.error`, and `logging.exception` calls at appropriate points in the function.  `logging.exception` is *crucial* because it includes the full stack trace when an unexpected error happens, making debugging much easier.
* **Error Handling:** Wraps the core logic in a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential errors. Logs specific error messages for `ValueError` and logs general exceptions with `logging.exception`. This is very important to prevent the program from crashing.  Returning `None` (or raising a custom exception, which might be better in some cases) from the function when an error occurs is also good practice.  The caller needs to check for `None`.
* **Logging Levels:** Uses `logging.info` for general information, `logging.debug` for detailed information that's only useful when debugging, and `logging.error` for error conditions. `logging.exception` handles unexpected errors.  You can control the verbosity of the logging by setting the logging level (e.g., to `logging.DEBUG` to see debug messages).
* **String Formatting (f-strings):** Uses f-strings (e.g., `f"arg1={arg1}"`) for clear and concise log messages.  This is much better than older string formatting methods.
* **Configuration:**  Adds `logging.basicConfig` to configure the logger.  This is often done at the application level, but including it here makes the example self-contained.  If you have a more complex application, you would typically configure logging in a central place (e.g., a configuration file or at the start of the application). It is important that the configuration happens only once.
* **Return Value:**  The function now returns `None` if an error occurs, indicating that the operation failed. This makes it easier for calling code to handle errors.
* **Docstring:**  The docstring is updated to reflect the error handling and the possibility of returning `None`.
* **Handles All Exceptions**: Catches the broad exception base class to log *all* unexpected errors and prevent program termination.
* **`logging.exception`:** Uses `logging.exception` which is important, as it automatically includes the stack trace in the log message for any exceptions that are caught. This makes it easier to debug the issue later.
* **Example Error Condition:** Includes a simulated error condition (`if arg2 == 0`) to demonstrate error handling.

This improved version provides more comprehensive logging and error handling, making it easier to debug and maintain your code. Remember to adjust the logging levels and message formats to suit your specific needs.
