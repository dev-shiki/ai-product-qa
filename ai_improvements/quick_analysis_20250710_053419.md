# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 05:34:19  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions based on the project information:

1.  **Improve test coverage metrics:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, assess your test coverage percentage. Aim for comprehensive coverage, especially for critical `app/api` functionality (like `products.py`). Use tools like `pytest-cov` to identify untested code and write more tests to address those gaps.

2.  **Ensure API structure consistency:** Review `app/api/__init__.py` to ensure consistent API structuring. Use it to explicitly define the API's public interface. This enhances maintainability and readability by providing a clear entry point and controlling what modules are accessible.
