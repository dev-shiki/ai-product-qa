```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1, description="Maximum number of products to return. Must be between 1 and 100."),
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(
    query: str,
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1, description="Maximum number of search results to return. Must be between 1 and 50.")
):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1, description="Maximum number of top-rated products to return. Must be between 1 and 50.")
):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

**Explanation of Improvement:**

The most important security improvement is adding **input validation** for the `limit` parameter using `Query` with `ge` (greater than or equal to) and `le` (less than or equal to) constraints.

```python
limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1, description="Maximum number of products to return. Must be between 1 and 100.")
```

**Why this is a security improvement:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention:**  Without validation, a malicious user could provide a very large value for `limit` (e.g., `limit=1000000000`).  This could overload the server by forcing it to retrieve and process an excessive amount of data, potentially crashing the service or making it unresponsive to other users. By limiting the acceptable range of `limit`, we prevent this.
*   **Resource Control:**  Limiting the results also helps to manage the server's resources (memory, CPU) and prevents the API from becoming a bottleneck.
*   **Data Exposure Limitation:**  While not a direct vulnerability in this specific code, restricting the amount of data returned can indirectly limit the potential impact of other vulnerabilities (e.g., if a bug exists that allows a user to access unauthorized data, limiting the number of results limits the amount of data that can be exfiltrated).
*   **Improved API documentation**: The description helps API users understand the purpose and limitations of the parameter, contributing to proper usage.

**How the change works:**

*   `Query()`:  This replaces the default value assignment.  It tells FastAPI that the `limit` parameter is a query parameter and allows us to add validation rules.
*   `ge=1`:  Specifies that the value of `limit` must be greater than or equal to 1.
*   `le=100`:  Specifies that the value of `limit` must be less than or equal to 100.
*   `description`: Adds a description for the parameter, which improves API documentation in Swagger/ReDoc.

If a user provides a value for `limit` that is outside the allowed range (1-100), FastAPI will automatically return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error with a validation message, preventing the request from reaching the `product_service`.  This is a crucial first line of defense against malicious or accidental misuse of the API.
I have applied these changes to the `/`, `/search` and `/top-rated` routes since they all have the potentially vulnerable `limit` parameter.
