**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security concern addressed is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, although the sanitization can also help mitigate other injection-based attacks.  Specifically, the keyword passed to `search_products` and subsequently logged could be attacker-controlled.  If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `keyword` parameter (e.g., through a URL parameter), that code will be logged. If the logs are then viewed in a web browser, the JavaScript will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions.  Even if the logs are not viewed in a browser, injecting shell commands into the log could be a serious issue.

The solution is to **sanitize the `keyword` before logging it**.  The `sanitize_keyword` function is introduced to escape potentially dangerous characters like `<` and `>` that are commonly used in HTML and JavaScript.  This converts them to their HTML entity equivalents (`&lt;` and `&gt;`), preventing the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Defense in Depth:** Sanitization acts as a defense-in-depth measure. Even if other input validation or output encoding mechanisms fail, sanitizing the log data can prevent the malicious code from executing.
*   **Logging as a Security Concern:** Logging is often overlooked as a potential attack vector. Attackers can exploit logging mechanisms to inject malicious code or sensitive information.
*   **Contextual Sanitization:**  The example provided uses basic HTML escaping as an example.  The *specific* sanitization method that you will need to apply depends heavily on how and where the keyword is used after it is logged.  If the keyword is passed to a database, you may need to also sanitize it for SQL injection.

**Further Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Context-Specific Sanitization:** The provided `sanitize_keyword` is a placeholder and provides basic HTML escaping. Depending on how the `keyword` is used (e.g., passed to a database, displayed in a web page), you might need more sophisticated sanitization or encoding techniques. For example, if you're using the keyword in a database query, you should use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. If you're displaying the keyword in a web page, you might need to use a more robust HTML escaping library or a templating engine with automatic escaping.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ideally, you would also perform input validation *before* the sanitization step.  This helps to ensure that the keyword adheres to an expected format (e.g., maximum length, allowed characters). Rejecting invalid input early reduces the attack surface.
*   **Logging Format:** Consider using a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to make it easier to parse and analyze log data. Structured logging can also help to prevent log injection attacks, where attackers try to inject malicious log entries to overwrite or tamper with existing log data.
*   **Auditing:** Regularly review your logs for any suspicious activity or errors.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep your logging libraries and dependencies up to date to patch any security vulnerabilities.

This single improvement addresses a significant security vulnerability related to logging potentially untrusted user input. Remember that this is a crucial step but may not be the only one necessary to fully secure the application.
