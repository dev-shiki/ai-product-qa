Key improvements and explanations:

* **Specific Exception Handling:**  Instead of catching a generic `Exception`, the code now catches `ValueError` and `AttributeError` explicitly.  `ValueError` is likely to occur if the API key is improperly formatted or invalid. `AttributeError` is very common when the API Key is not set and the application attempts to access `settings.GOOGLE_API_KEY` which results in a NoneType object not having the required attribute.  This allows for more targeted error handling and debugging.

* **Detailed Logging:**  The log messages are more informative, specifying the type of error encountered.

* **Traceback Logging:** `logger.exception()` is used instead of `logger.error()` in the generic `except` block.  `logger.exception()` *automatically* includes the full traceback information in the log message, which is *critical* for debugging unexpected errors. This makes it much easier to pinpoint the exact line of code that caused the problem.

* **Re-raising Exceptions:** The `raise` statement after logging in each `except` block is *crucial*.  The purpose of the `__init__` method is to set up the AI service. If it fails during initialization (e.g., due to a missing API key), the service *cannot* function correctly.  Re-raising the exception ensures that the caller (the code that's trying to use the `AIService`) is notified of the failure and can handle it appropriately (e.g., retry initialization, display an error message to the user, or shut down the application).  Without re-raising, the caller might proceed under the false assumption that the service is ready, leading to potentially more difficult-to-diagnose errors later on.

* **Clarity and Readability:** The code remains clean and easy to understand, with clear log messages that provide context for the errors.

Why these changes are important:

* **Robustness:** The AI service is now more resilient to common errors, such as missing or invalid API keys.
* **Debuggability:**  When errors occur, the detailed logging (especially the traceback) makes it much easier to identify the root cause.
* **Maintainability:**  Specific exception handling makes the code easier to understand and maintain, as it's clear what types of errors are being handled.
* **Correctness:** Re-raising exceptions ensures that errors during initialization are not ignored, preventing the application from entering an inconsistent or undefined state.

This revised code significantly improves the error handling in the `AIService`'s `__init__` method, making it more robust, debuggable, and maintainable.  It ensures that initialization errors are properly handled and propagated to the caller.
