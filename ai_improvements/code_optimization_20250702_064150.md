# Code Optimization

## Improvement

**Improvement:** Move `settings = get_settings()` outside of the `__init__` method and use `functools.lru_cache` to memoize the result.

**Explanation:**

Currently, `get_settings()` is called every time an `AIService` object is instantiated.  Assuming `get_settings()` involves reading configuration files or making external calls, this can be a significant performance bottleneck, especially if you create many `AIService` instances.

Memoization (using `lru_cache`) ensures that `get_settings()` is only executed once, and its result is cached for subsequent calls.  This drastically reduces the overhead of repeatedly retrieving the same settings.  This is safe to do if the settings rarely or never change during the application's runtime.

Here's the improved code (including necessary imports):

```python
import logging
from google import genai
from app.utils.config import get_settings
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
import functools

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def cached_get_settings():
    return get_settings()


class AIService:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize AI service with Google AI API"""
        try:
            settings = cached_get_settings()  # Use the cached version
            # Use the new Google AI client
            self.client = genai.Client(api_key=settings.GOOGLE_API_KEY)
            self.product_service = ProductDataService()
            logger.info("Successfully initialized AI service with Google AI client")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error initializing AI service: {str(e)}")
            raise

    async def get_response(self, question: str) -> str:
        # ... rest of your code
        pass  # Placeholder
```

Key benefits:

*   **Performance:** Drastically reduces the time taken to initialize `AIService` objects, especially if `get_settings()` is slow.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Avoids unnecessary repeated reads from configuration files or external sources.
*   **Simplicity:** Relatively easy to implement with `functools.lru_cache`. `maxsize=1` is appropriate here as we just want to memoize the latest (and only) call.

Caveats:

*   If your settings *do* change during runtime and you need to reflect those changes in `AIService`, you'll need to invalidate the cache manually (e.g., by clearing the cache of `cached_get_settings` function) or reconsider this approach. This assumption of static configuration is extremely common.
*   This assumes `get_settings()` is a pure function (i.e., it always returns the same output for the same input, and it has no side effects). This is generally true for configuration loading functions.
