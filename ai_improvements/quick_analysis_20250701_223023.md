## Quick Insights

Given the structure, here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1. **Centralize Configuration:**  Instead of potentially scattering configurations across multiple files, create a central configuration file (e.g., `config.py` in the `app` directory) to manage settings like API endpoints, database connections, and feature flags. This enhances maintainability and makes it easier to modify settings in one place.

2. **Improve Testability with Dependency Injection:**  In modules like `app/api/products.py`, consider using dependency injection (even simple constructor injection) to make the code more testable.  Avoid direct instantiation of dependencies. This allows for mocking during testing.
