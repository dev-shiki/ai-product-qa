## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Introduce a linter and formatter (e.g., Flake8 and Black).** Standardizing code style improves readability and reduces potential errors.  Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks on every commit.

2.  **Assess test coverage and target improvement.** While you have tests, measure the actual code coverage. Aim for a reasonable target (e.g., 80%) and identify areas needing more tests, especially around core business logic in files like `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`.
