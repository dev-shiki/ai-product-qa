## Quick Insights

Given a small Python project with 21 files and 8 tests, prioritize improving modularity and test coverage.

1. **Enforce consistent structure & imports:** With 21 files, ensure a clear and consistent module structure.  Use relative imports (e.g., `from .. import utils`) within the `app` directory to improve code clarity and maintainability.

2. **Increase test coverage:** While 8 test files is a start, analyze code coverage reports. Focus on testing edge cases and complex logic, particularly in critical files like `products.py`. Aim for higher coverage percentages to minimize potential bugs.
