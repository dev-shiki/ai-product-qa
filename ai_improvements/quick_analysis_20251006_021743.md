**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:**  With 21 Python files, consider using a centralized configuration (e.g., using `configparser` or a `settings.py` file) to manage environment variables, database connection details, and other application-wide settings.  This avoids scattered hardcoded values and makes configuration changes easier.

2. **Improve Testing Structure:** The ratio of code files to test files (21:8) suggests potential gaps in test coverage. Evaluate if tests adequately cover critical functions and edge cases, particularly in core logic within files like `queries.py` and `products.py`. Consider aiming for higher test coverage using tools like `pytest` with `coverage.py`.
