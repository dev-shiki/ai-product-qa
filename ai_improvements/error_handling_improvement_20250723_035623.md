```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`safe_operation(func, *args, **kwargs)` Function:** This function is the core of the improved error handling.  It takes the function to be executed, along with its arguments, and wraps it in a `try...except` block.  This allows us to centrally handle errors that might occur during the function's execution.

* **Comprehensive Logging:**  Instead of just printing an error, the `logger.exception()` method is used. This is CRUCIAL.  `logger.exception()` automatically logs the full traceback, including the file name, line number, and the entire call stack where the exception occurred.  This makes debugging significantly easier. The traceback provides context, helping you pinpoint the exact source of the problem. Using a logger is best practice compared to printing, as loggers can be configured more easily for different environments (development, production).

* **Return Value with Error Indication:** The `safe_operation` function returns a tuple: `(result, error)`.  This provides a clear way to determine if the operation was successful or if an error occurred.
    * If `error` is `None`, the operation was successful, and `result` contains the function's return value.
    * If `error` is not `None`, it contains the exception object that was caught, and `result` is `None`.  This allows the calling code to decide how to handle the error: log it, raise it, or attempt a recovery strategy.  This is a very flexible and useful pattern.

* **Example Usage with `if __name__ == '__main__':`:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to use the `safe_operation` function.  It shows how to check for errors and handle them accordingly.  Critically, I included an example of handling an exception.

* **Clear Error Messages:** The `f"Error during execution of {func.__name__}: {e}"` part of the logging message includes the name of the function that caused the error (`func.__name__`) and the error message itself (`e`). This makes the logs much more informative.

* **Centralized Error Handling:**  This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability.  Instead of repeating `try...except` blocks throughout your code, you can use the `safe_operation` function to handle errors in a consistent way. This simplifies your code and makes it easier to modify and debug.

* **Flexibility:**  The `safe_operation` function is generic and can be used with any function.  It accepts arbitrary arguments using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

* **Avoid `except Exception` without logging:**  Catching `Exception` is broad, but in this context, it's paired with detailed logging. This allows you to catch any unexpected errors and log them, while still preventing the program from crashing.  The logging is key.

How to use it:

1. **Copy the code** into your `utility_modules.py` file (or whatever file you're using for utilities).
2. **Import the `safe_operation` function** into your module where you need to handle potential errors: `from utility_modules import safe_operation`
3. **Wrap the potentially error-prone function call** with `safe_operation`:

   ```python
   from utility_modules import safe_operation
   import json


   def load_json_from_file(filepath):
       """Loads JSON data from a file."""
       with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
           data = json.load(f)
       return data

   def process_data(filepath):
       data, err = safe_operation(load_json_from_file, filepath)  # Wrap the call
       if err:
           print(f"Failed to load JSON from {filepath}: {err}")
           # Handle the error (e.g., return a default value, retry, exit)
           return None  # Or whatever is appropriate
       else:
           # Process the data
           print(f"Successfully loaded JSON: {data}")
           return data # or do something with the data
   ```

This significantly improves the error handling by:

* **Providing detailed error information (tracebacks) in the logs.**
* **Returning error information to the caller.**
* **Centralizing error handling logic.**
* **Making the code more robust and easier to debug.**
* **Logging all exceptions, making it easier to find unexpected errors.**
