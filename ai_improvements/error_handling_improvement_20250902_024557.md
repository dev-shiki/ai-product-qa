## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            data = response.json()
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert data == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP Error: {e}.  Status Code: {e.response.status_code}. Response Body: {e.response.text}") #Added response body for more detailed error reporting.
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            data = response.json()
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert data["status"] == "healthy"
            assert data["version"] == "1.0.0"
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP Error: {e}. Status Code: {e.response.status_code}. Response Body: {e.response.text}") #Added response body for more detailed error reporting.
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This is the most important addition.  It's called on the `response` object after making the HTTP request. It automatically raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception if the response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx).  This avoids the test passing even when the server returns an error.  This is the *correct* way to handle HTTP errors.

* **`try...except` block:** The code that makes the HTTP request and asserts the results is wrapped in a `try...except` block. This allows us to gracefully handle potential exceptions that might occur during the request or assertion process.

* **`HTTPStatusError` handling:** The `except HTTPStatusError as e:` block specifically catches the `HTTPStatusError` that `response.raise_for_status()` might raise.  This means we can now *detect* and *report* HTTP errors in the tests, making them much more reliable. The pytest.fail allows us to mark a test as a failure and add custom messages to the pytest output.  The error message now includes the status code and the response body, making debugging *much* easier.

* **General `Exception` handling:** The `except Exception as e:` block catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur (e.g., network errors, JSON decoding errors, assertion errors that are not covered by the HTTP Status).  This ensures that the test fails gracefully and provides useful information about the error.

* **Detailed Error Reporting:** The `pytest.fail()` calls now provide much more context in the error message, including:
    * The type of error (`HTTPError`, `Exception`)
    * The error message itself.
    * The HTTP status code if it was an HTTP error.
    * *Crucially* the response body, to see exactly what the server sent back in the event of an error.  This is invaluable for debugging.

Why these changes are important:

* **Robustness:** The tests will now correctly fail if the server returns an error, preventing false positives.
* **Debuggability:**  The improved error messages make it much easier to identify the cause of test failures, especially when dealing with API errors.
* **Reliability:**  The tests are more reliable because they handle a wider range of potential errors.

This improved version will give you much more confidence in your API tests. Remember to install `httpx`: `pip install httpx`
