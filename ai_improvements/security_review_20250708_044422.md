## Improvement

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from functools import lru_cache
import logging
import os

# Setup logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # API Configuration
    GOOGLE_API_KEY: str
    API_HOST: str = "localhost"
    API_PORT: int = 8000
    FRONTEND_HOST: str = "localhost"
    FRONTEND_PORT: int = 8501
    DEBUG: bool = True

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        if not self.GOOGLE_API_KEY or self.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "your-google-api-key-here":
            logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is not set or is using default value")
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY must be set in .env file")

        # Secure check:  Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY has reasonable length to prevent accidental leakage
        if len(self.GOOGLE_API_KEY) < 20:
             logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is suspiciously short. Possible configuration error.")
             raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY is too short and potentially invalid.")


@lru_cache()
def get_settings():
    return Settings()

settings = get_settings()
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

I've added a length check for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

```python
        if len(self.GOOGLE_API_KEY) < 20:
             logger.error("GOOGLE_API_KEY is suspiciously short. Possible configuration error.")
             raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY is too short and potentially invalid.")
```

**Reasoning:**

A Google API key should be a string of a specific length. A very short or empty API key is almost certainly an error and could lead to unintended consequences, such as using a default value, exposing an invalid key (making it seem like no key is required), or triggering an error later in the program that might be difficult to debug.  By checking the length of the API key, we can catch this configuration mistake early and prevent the program from running with potentially incorrect credentials.  This helps prevent accidental leakage or misuse due to misconfiguration. I chose a length of 20 as a reasonably safe lower bound, but you should adjust it based on the expected length of *your* Google API key. Note that this is not foolproof security, but adds a layer of protection.
