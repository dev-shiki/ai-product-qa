## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Move the `app` and `AsyncClient` instantiation outside the test functions.

**Improved Code:**

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from app.main import app  # Import app here

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def async_client():
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac  # Provide the client to the tests


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Explanation:**

The original code created a new instance of the `AsyncClient` and the FastAPI `app` for *each* test function.  Creating these objects can have some overhead. Instead, we use a `pytest` fixture to create the `AsyncClient` only *once* per test module. This reduces the overhead of creating a new client for each test, resulting in faster test execution, especially when many tests are run. The scope `module` ensures the client is created at the beginning of the module and destroyed at the end. `async_client` fixture provides this client to all the test functions in the module that need it.
