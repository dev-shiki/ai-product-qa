## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Introduce a linter (e.g., Flake8, pylint) and formatter (e.g., Black):**  With 21 Python files, maintaining consistent code style becomes crucial. A linter will identify potential errors and style issues, while a formatter ensures code conforms to a standard style, improving readability and maintainability.

2.  **Implement Continuous Integration (CI):** Use a CI tool (like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) to automatically run tests and linting/formatting checks on every code change. This helps catch bugs early and ensures code quality is consistently maintained.
