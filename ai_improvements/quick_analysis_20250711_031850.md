**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the structure with `app` and `test` directories, and considering API files, I recommend:

1. **Implement Linting and Formatting:** Integrate a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a formatter (like Black) into your workflow. This ensures code style consistency across all 21 files, improving readability and maintainability.  Include them in pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines.

2. **Improve Testing Structure:**  Ensure that your 8 test files provide adequate coverage across core functionalities, especially the API endpoints (`products.py`).  Consider using a testing framework like pytest and strive for modular, well-organized tests that mirror the `app`'s structure.
