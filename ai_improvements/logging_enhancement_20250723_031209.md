# Logging Enhancement

**Time**: 03:12:09  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (basic example)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    logger.info(f"Received request for get_products with limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}")
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved {len(products)} products.")
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("An error occurred during get_products") # Logs the exception with traceback
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  The crucial `import logging` statement is added.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up basic logging.  You'll likely want a more sophisticated configuration in a real application (e.g., file-based logging, different log levels).  This is a minimal working example.
* **Logger Instance:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance.  Using `__name__` as the logger name is best practice; it helps you identify which module the log message came from.
* **`logger.info()` at start:** A logging statement `logger.info(...)` is added at the beginning of the function to log the incoming request parameters. This is useful for debugging and auditing.  It logs the values of `limit`, `category`, and `search`.
* **`logger.info()` on success:**  A logging statement is added after successfully retrieving the products, indicating the number of products retrieved. This helps confirm successful operation.
* **`logger.exception()` on error:**  The `logger.exception()` method is used inside the `except` block.  This is *critical*. `logger.exception()` automatically logs the exception message *and* the full traceback, which is essential for debugging errors.  This is far more useful than just logging `str(e)`.  It provides the context of the error.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The logging messages are formatted to be clear and informative.
* **No Unnecessary Logging:**  The code focuses on logging the most important events: request received, successful retrieval, and errors.  Avoid adding excessive logging that clutters the logs without providing valuable information.

How to use the logging:

1.  **Run your FastAPI application.**
2.  **Make requests to the `/` endpoint (e.g., using `curl`, Postman, or a browser).**
3.  **Check your console output.**  You should see log messages similar to this:

```
INFO:root:Received request for get_products with limit=20, category=None, search=None
INFO:root:Successfully retrieved 10 products.
```

If an error occurs, you'll see a traceback in the logs, which will help you diagnose the problem.

This revised answer provides a complete, correct, and best-practice implementation of logging within the specified FastAPI function.  It addresses all the issues from the previous responses and offers a robust solution for debugging and monitoring your application.  Remember to tailor the logging level and configuration to your specific needs in a production environment.
