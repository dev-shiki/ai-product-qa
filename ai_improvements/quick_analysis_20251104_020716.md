## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Introduce Linting & Formatting:** Implement a linter like `flake8` and a formatter like `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This improves readability and reduces potential errors, especially with multiple contributors.

2.  **Implement logging:** Add a logging configuration for your application. Use this to log the steps that the applications takes, instead of using prints, so it's easy to enable or disable.
