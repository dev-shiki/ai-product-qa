from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()

    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:

        try:

            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword '{keyword}': {str(e)}")
            # Consider raising the exception or returning a more informative error object
            # For example, you could return an empty list with an error message as metadata:
            # return [], {"error": str(e)}
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return await self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)

            # Instead of always returning local products, handle different error scenarios
            # You could re-raise the exception if the local service is also failing,
            # or return a specific error response to the client.
            # If falling back to the local service, log a warning:
            logger.warning("Falling back to local product service after an error.")
            return self.local_service.get_products(limit)

Key improvements in error handling:

* **`logger.exception()` instead of `logger.error()`:**  The most crucial change. `logger.exception()` *automatically* includes the traceback in the log message.  This is invaluable for debugging.  With `logger.error()`, you only see the error message; you don't know where it originated unless you manually include the traceback (which is often forgotten).  `logger.exception()` eliminates this problem.
* **Contextual Logging:** The logging messages now include the values of variables that were passed to the functions (e.g., the `keyword` in `search_products`, the `limit`, `category`, and `search` parameters in `get_products`).  This makes it much easier to diagnose problems because you know exactly what the service was trying to do when the error occurred.
* **More Specific Error Handling in `get_products`:**  Instead of blindly falling back to `local_service.get_products()`, the code now *warns* that a fallback is occurring. This is important because a fallback might not be ideal, and you want to know if your primary data source is consistently failing.  It also suggests other potential error handling strategies, such as re-raising the exception (if the local service is also expected to be unreliable) or returning a specific error response to the client (giving the client more information about the failure).
* **Considered Returning Error Objects/Messages:** Added a comment to `search_products` illustrating returning an empty list along with an error message for the caller to handle.

These changes significantly enhance the debuggability and robustness of the `ProductDataService`.  By logging exceptions and adding contextual information, you'll have a much easier time identifying and resolving issues. The more nuanced error handling in `get_products` also prevents masking problems and allows for more graceful degradation.
