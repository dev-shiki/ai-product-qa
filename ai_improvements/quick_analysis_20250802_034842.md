**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider using a linter and formatter:**  Tools like `flake8` or `pylint` can identify potential code quality issues across all 21 Python files.  `black` or `autopep8` can automatically format the code to a consistent style, enhancing readability and maintainability. This would ensure best practice across the codebase.

2.  **Check test coverage:**  With 8 test files for 21 source files, evaluate the test coverage.  Tools like `coverage.py` will identify which parts of the code are not tested.  Prioritize writing tests for uncovered critical functionalities, especially in files like `app/models/product.py` as it likely contains important business logic.
