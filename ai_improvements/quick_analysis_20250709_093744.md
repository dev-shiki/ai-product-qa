## Quick Insights

Given the project structure and file count, here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Improve Test Organization:** Create a clear, mirrored directory structure for your tests. For example, mirroring `app/api/products.py` with `tests/app/api/test_products.py`. This aids maintainability and makes locating tests much easier.

2.  **Add Type Hinting:** Gradually introduce type hints throughout the codebase. This increases code readability, helps prevent errors during development, and allows for better static analysis. Start with core modules like `products.py`.
