## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`**: This is the core of the improvement.  It's called *after* the `await ac.get("/")` call.  This method checks the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code is in the 4xx (client error) or 5xx (server error) range, it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception.  This is crucial for detecting and handling errors like 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, etc.  Without this, the test would blindly continue and likely fail with an assertion error, but without clear indication of the *actual* problem.

* **`try...except` block**:  A `try...except` block is wrapped around the `await ac.get("/")` and `response.raise_for_status()` calls. This allows us to catch potential exceptions that might occur during the request.

* **`except HTTPStatusError as e`**:  This specifically catches the `HTTPStatusError` that `response.raise_for_status()` can raise.  This is the *expected* failure case when the server returns an error.  The `pytest.fail(f"Request failed: {e}")` then reports the error clearly, including the error message from the HTTPStatusError.

* **`except Exception as e`**: This is a general exception handler that catches *any* other exception that might occur during the request (e.g., network errors, connection refused, etc.).  This ensures that the test doesn't crash due to unexpected errors and provides a helpful error message.

* **`pytest.fail()`**: Instead of allowing the test to continue to the `assert` statements (which would then fail, but potentially obscure the *real* cause), `pytest.fail()` immediately marks the test as failed and reports the error message. This provides a much more informative error report when something goes wrong.

Why this is better:

1. **Clearer Error Reporting**:  Instead of a cryptic assertion failure, you get a message like "Request failed: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: /" or "An unexpected error occurred: Connection refused". This makes debugging much easier.

2. **Handles Real-World Failures**:  Web services are not always perfect.  This improved error handling gracefully deals with situations where the server is down, returns an error, or has unexpected problems.

3. **More Robust Tests**:  Tests that handle errors are more reliable and give you greater confidence in the stability of your application.

4. **Prevents Masked Failures**: By catching exceptions and immediately failing the test, you prevent situations where a failing request leads to a cascade of assertion errors, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause.

This approach makes your tests significantly more resilient and provides much better diagnostics when failures occur.  Remember to apply this pattern to all your tests that interact with external services or potentially unreliable components.
