## Quick Insights

1.  **Standardize imports:** Enforce consistent import style (e.g., absolute vs. relative) across all modules using a linter like `flake8` with `isort`. This improves readability and maintainability.

2.  **Test organization:** While 8 test files is a good start, consider aligning the test structure more closely with the application structure. For example, create a `tests/api/test_products.py` to mirror `app/api/products.py`. This improves test discoverability and organization.
