## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consistent Linting/Formatting:** Implement a consistent code style using a tool like Black and a linter like Flake8 (or Ruff). This improves readability, reduces style-related code review comments, and can catch potential errors.

2.  **Test Structure/Coverage:** Assess test coverage and consider a more structured approach to tests if needed. Ensure tests cover critical functionalities in the main app and focus on edge cases and error handling, increasing the reliability of your application.
