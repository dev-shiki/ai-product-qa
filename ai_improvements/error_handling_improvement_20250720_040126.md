## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements:

* **`try...except` block:**  Encloses the `ac.get()` call and subsequent `response.raise_for_status()` in a `try...except` block. This is crucial for catching potential errors during the HTTP request.
* **`response.raise_for_status()`:** This method is the heart of the improvement.  It automatically raises an `HTTPStatusError` if the HTTP response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). This allows you to explicitly handle error responses from the API.  Without this, the test could silently pass even if the API is returning an error.
* **Specific Exception Handling:** Catches `HTTPStatusError` to specifically handle HTTP errors, providing more informative error messages. A general `Exception` catch ensures that *any* error during the request (e.g., network issues, connection errors) is caught and fails the test.
* **`pytest.fail()`:**  Instead of letting exceptions propagate and potentially give confusing traceback output,  `pytest.fail()` is used to explicitly signal a test failure with a clear, informative message. This makes it much easier to diagnose the cause of the test failure.
* **Informative Error Messages:** The `pytest.fail()` calls include the exception message (`e`), providing more context about what went wrong (e.g., the specific status code and reason phrase from the `HTTPStatusError`).

This improved version makes the test more robust by:

1.  **Explicitly checking for HTTP errors.**
2.  **Handling unexpected exceptions.**
3.  **Providing clear and helpful error messages when a test fails.** This makes debugging much easier.
