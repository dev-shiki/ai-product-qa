# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:35:48  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider a Linter/Formatter:** With 21 Python files, inconsistent code style is likely. Integrate a linter like `flake8` (for style issues) and a formatter like `black` (for automatic code formatting). This promotes readability and collaboration.

2.  **Evaluate Test Coverage:** 8 test files alongside 21 source files might indicate insufficient test coverage. Use a coverage tool like `pytest-cov` to identify untested areas. Aim for a high coverage percentage to ensure robustness, especially around core logic in files like `queries.py` and `products.py`.
