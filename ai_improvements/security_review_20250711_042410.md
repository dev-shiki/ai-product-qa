## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService
import re


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Test response"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        assert response == "Test response"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_error():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_generate.side_effect = Exception("API Error")
        
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        assert "Maaf, saya sedang mengalami kesulitan" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_empty_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("")
        assert "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_long_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        long_question = "A" * 1000
        response = await service.get_response(long_question)
        assert "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_special_characters():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan mengandung karakter spesial"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        special_char_question = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"  # Example XSS payload
        response = await service.get_response(special_char_question)
        assert "Pertanyaan mengandung karakter spesial" in response
```

**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The original code lacked input sanitization, specifically in how it handled special characters. This created a potential vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the `AIService` used the input in a web context without proper encoding.

The added test `test_get_response_with_special_characters()` is designed to check how the code handles special characters.  If the `AIService` doesn't sanitize these inputs, then there's a risk that malicious code can be injected.

**Why this is important:**

*   **XSS Prevention:** XSS attacks can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to stolen credentials, session hijacking, or the defacement of websites.

**Important Notes**

This response only provides one test to illustrate the possible XSS vulnerability.  The appropriate resolution will depend on the AIService class and how it handles input.  A more comprehensive security test would include a range of possible XSS payloads.
