# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_config.py`  
**Time**: 02:50:02  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure basic logging

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    logging.info("Starting test_settings_invalid")
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    logging.info("Set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable to 'your-google-api-key-here'")
    from app.utils import config
    logging.info("Imported app.utils.config")
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        logging.info("Expecting ValueError to be raised")
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
    logging.info("Finished test_settings_invalid")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging` and `logging.basicConfig`:**  This is crucial.  You need to import the `logging` module and, ideally, configure it at the start of your script. `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up basic logging to the console with the INFO level.  You can change the level (e.g., `logging.DEBUG` for more verbose output).  Without this, the logging statements won't do anything.  Best practice is to configure logging at the *module* level, not within individual functions.

* **Informative Messages:** The log messages now clearly state what's happening.  "Starting test...", "Set GOOGLE_API_KEY...", "Imported config...",  "Expecting ValueError..." are all much more useful than generic messages.

* **Placed *before* the action:** The `logging.info` calls generally *precede* the action they're describing.  This way, if the action *fails*, you'll still have a log entry indicating what you were *about* to do.  If you put the log *after* the action, you won't know if the action ever happened if it crashed.

* **`with pytest.raises` context manager logging:**  Special care is taken with the `with pytest.raises` block.  A log message *inside* the block indicates that the code *entered* the `with` statement, and that a `ValueError` is *expected*.  This is vital for debugging this type of test.

* **No try/except:** No `try...except` block is added. `pytest.raises` already handles the exception and asserts that it is raised.  Adding an explicit `try...except` would defeat the purpose of using `pytest.raises`.

How to Run and See the Logs:

1.  **Save the code:**  Save the above code (including the logging setup) in a file, let's say `test_config.py`.  Also, make sure you have the `app.utils.config` module available, as the tests import from it.
2.  **Run with pytest:**  From your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_config.py` and run:
    ```bash
    pytest -v -s test_config.py
    ```

    *   `-v` (verbose) will give you more detailed test output.
    *   `-s` is *essential*.  It tells pytest *not* to capture the standard output (where the logs go). Without `-s`, pytest will capture the logs, and you won't see them unless the test fails.

You should now see the log messages interleaved with the pytest output in your terminal. If you're using an IDE like VS Code with the pytest extension, configure it to show standard output/captured logs.

This revised solution provides robust and meaningful logging, enabling you to effectively debug the test and understand its execution flow.  Remember to adapt the logging level and messages to suit the specific needs of your application.
