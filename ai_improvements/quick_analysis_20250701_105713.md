## Quick Insights

1.  **Centralize Configuration:** Instead of potentially scattering configuration (database URLs, API keys) across multiple files, introduce a central configuration module (e.g., `app/config.py`). This improves maintainability and allows for easier environment-specific settings via environment variables.

2.  **Improve Test Structure/Naming:** Consider organizing tests to mirror the application structure (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py`). Consistent naming conventions (e.g., functions prefixed with `test_`) and utilizing fixtures can enhance test readability and organization, especially with 8 files.
