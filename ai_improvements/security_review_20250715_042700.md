## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Consider tightening this to specific origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Consider tightening this to specific methods (e.g., "GET", "POST")
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Consider tightening this to specific headers
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The most immediate security concern in the provided code is the overly permissive CORS configuration.  Specifically, `allow_origins=["*"]`, `allow_methods=["*"]`, and `allow_headers=["*"]`. This configuration essentially allows *any* website to make requests to your API, potentially exposing it to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and other vulnerabilities.

**The improvement is to tighten the CORS configuration by defining specific origins, methods, and headers allowed to communicate with the API.**

**Example of a more secure CORS configuration:**

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",  # Example: Allow requests from your local development frontend
        "https://your-production-domain.com", # Example: Allow requests from your production frontend
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"], #Only allow these specific methods
    allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization"], # Only allow these specific headers.  Crucial for security.
)
```

**Why this is more secure:**

*   **`allow_origins`**:  Specifying the exact origins that are allowed to make requests to your API restricts access, preventing malicious websites from interacting with it on behalf of unsuspecting users.  This is the most critical improvement.  **`*` should *never* be used in production.**

*   **`allow_methods`**:  Limiting the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that are allowed helps to prevent unexpected API behavior.  For example, if your API is only designed to handle GET and POST requests, then you should explicitly specify those methods.

*   **`allow_headers`**:  Controlling which headers are allowed in requests helps to prevent malicious actors from injecting unexpected headers that could compromise security.  Only allow headers that your API explicitly expects and processes.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context Matters:** The specific origins, methods, and headers you should allow will depend on the design and requirements of your application.

*   **Iterative Approach:** Start with a restrictive CORS configuration and gradually loosen it as needed, while carefully considering the security implications of each change.

*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use environment variables or configuration files to manage CORS settings for different environments (development, staging, production). For example, in development, you might temporarily allow `*` for origins, but **never** in production.  Use your `settings` object for this purpose.  The original code *already* imports this for a reason!
