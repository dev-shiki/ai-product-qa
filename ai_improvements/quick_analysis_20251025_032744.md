**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Enhance Code Organization:** With 21 files, consider grouping related modules into subpackages within `app`. For instance, `app/api` could be further structured (e.g., `app/api/v1/`) to handle API versions or functional areas, improving maintainability and navigation.

2. **Prioritize Testing:** Aim for a 1:1 or even 2:1 (test:code) ratio for critical modules. Assess code coverage from the existing tests; if low, write more tests, especially for complex logic in files like `queries.py` and `products.py`, focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure robustness.
