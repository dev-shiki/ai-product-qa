## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to / failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred during the request to /: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to /health failed: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred during the request to /health: {e}")

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

Key improvements:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`:**  This is the core of improved error handling.  It checks the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `HTTPStatusError` exception.  This allows you to explicitly handle HTTP errors.
* **`try...except` block:**  The `await ac.get("/")` call is wrapped in a `try...except` block.  This allows us to catch potential errors that might occur during the HTTP request.
* **Specific Exception Handling:** Two `except` blocks are added.
    * `HTTPStatusError`:  Catches HTTP errors explicitly. The `pytest.fail()` call provides a more informative error message indicating the endpoint that failed and the nature of the HTTP error.
    * `Exception`: Catches any other unexpected exceptions that might occur (e.g., network errors, connection issues, encoding problems).  This prevents the test from silently failing and provides a more general error message.
* **`pytest.fail()`:** Instead of simply letting the test fail with a generic traceback, `pytest.fail()` is used to explicitly mark the test as failed *and* provide a descriptive error message. This makes debugging much easier.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The error messages within `pytest.fail()` clearly indicate which endpoint the error occurred on (e.g., "Request to / failed") and include the original exception message for more context.

This revised code provides robust error handling, ensuring that your tests are reliable and provide useful information when errors occur during HTTP requests. It specifically addresses HTTP errors and also catches general exceptions, making the tests more resilient.
