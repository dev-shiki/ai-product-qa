```python

import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import time
import os  # Import the 'os' module

# Configuration
# API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # Removed hardcoded localhost
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000") # Use environment variable, fallback to localhost

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is replacing the hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` with an environment variable:

```python
# API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # Removed hardcoded localhost
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000") # Use environment variable, fallback to localhost
```

**Why is this more secure?**

*   **Avoids Hardcoding Sensitive Information:**  Hardcoding configuration values, including URLs, directly into the code is a bad practice.  If the API URL needs to change (e.g., when deploying to a different environment like production), you would need to modify and redeploy the code.  This can lead to errors and security risks if you accidentally commit the production URL to a public repository, or if the production URL contains credentials.

*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:**  Using environment variables allows you to configure the application differently for various environments (development, testing, production) without changing the code itself.  You can set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable differently on each environment.

*   **Centralized Configuration:** Environment variables can be managed centrally by the deployment platform (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud providers). This makes it easier to update configuration without redeploying the application.

*   **Fallback Mechanism:** The `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")` part includes a fallback. If the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable is *not* set, the application will default to `http://localhost:8000`. This is useful for local development where you might not want to set the environment variable.

**How to use environment variables:**

The exact way to set environment variables depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  Here are a few common ways:

*   **Local Development (Command Line):**

    *   Linux/macOS: `export API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com`
    *   Windows: `set API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com`

*   **Docker:**  Use the `ENV` instruction in your Dockerfile or the `-e` flag when running the container.

*   **Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):** Each provider has its own way to set environment variables for applications.  Usually, this is done through the service configuration (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure App Service, Google Cloud Run).

**In summary,** using environment variables for configuration is a standard security best practice that makes your application more flexible, secure, and easier to manage.
