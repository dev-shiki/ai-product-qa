## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Consider a linter and formatter:** With 21 Python files, enforcing consistent style is crucial. Integrate a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black` or `autopep8`) to automatically identify and fix style issues, improving readability and maintainability across the project.

2.  **Improve test coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 code files, analyze test coverage. Use a coverage tool (like `pytest-cov`) to identify untested code sections. Focus on testing critical logic in `queries.py` and `products.py` for robustness, ensuring core API functionalities are well-tested.
