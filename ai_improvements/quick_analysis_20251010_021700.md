## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Linting/Formatting:** With 21 Python files, consistent code style is crucial. Implement a linter (like pylint or flake8) and a code formatter (like Black or autopep8). This automates style checks and formatting, reducing code review burden and improving readability across the project.

2.  **Test Organization:** Having 8 test files is good! Consider organizing your tests to mirror your application structure (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py` mirroring `app/api/products.py`). This will improve test discovery and maintainability as your project grows.
