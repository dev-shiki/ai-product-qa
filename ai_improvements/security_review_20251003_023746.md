## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1),  # Limit the limit to prevent DOS
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1)):  # Limit the limit
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1)): # Limit the limit
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

**Explanation:**

The suggested security improvement is to **limit the maximum value of the `limit` parameter** in the `get_products`, `search_products` and `get_top_rated_products` endpoints.  This is done by using `Query` and adding `le` (less than or equal to) and `ge` (greater than or equal to) constraints to the `limit` parameter.

*   **Why is this important?**

    Without a limit on the `limit` parameter, a malicious user could specify a very large number (e.g., `limit=1000000`).  If the `product_service.get_products()` method (and similar methods) attempts to retrieve and process this many products, it could lead to:

    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The server could become overwhelmed with processing the request, making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server could run out of memory or other resources, causing it to crash.
    *   **Database Load:** A large `limit` could place excessive load on the database.

*   **How it works:**

    By adding `limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1)` we are explicitly telling FastAPI to expect an optional integer parameter called limit, that it should default to 20, that it should be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100. FastAPI will automatically validate the input and raise an exception if the limit is outside this range.  This prevents the backend service from being overloaded by requests for an excessively large number of products. `Query` is imported from `fastapi` to enable these features.

*   **Why 100/50?**

    The specific maximum values (100 for `/` and 50 for other endoints) are arbitrary examples.  The appropriate values will depend on your application's performance characteristics, the size of your product catalog, and your desired level of protection against DoS attacks.  You should choose a value that allows legitimate users to retrieve a reasonable number of products while preventing malicious users from overwhelming the system. You can choose different values for different endpoints according to their expected use cases.

This simple change adds a crucial layer of protection against potential abuse and helps ensure the stability and availability of your API.  While other security improvements are possible, this is a straightforward and effective measure to address a common vulnerability.
