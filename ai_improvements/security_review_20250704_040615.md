## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os  # Import the os module

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Restrict CORS origins to a known list or environment variable
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1").split(",")


app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,  # Use the defined list of origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of the Improvement:**

The security improvement implemented is restricting the allowed origins for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

**Vulnerability:**

The original code used `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`.  This means that *any* website could make requests to your API. This is a security risk because a malicious website could potentially perform actions on behalf of a user who is logged into your API, or access sensitive data.

**Mitigation:**

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, where `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is populated from an environment variable:

1. **Environment Variable:**  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS = os.environ.get("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1").split(",")` retrieves the value of the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to "http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1".  The `.split(",")` converts this comma-separated string into a list of allowed origins.

2. **CORS Configuration:**  The `CORSMiddleware` is then configured to only allow requests from origins in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list.

**Why this is better:**

*   **Reduced Attack Surface:** By explicitly listing the allowed origins, you significantly reduce the attack surface of your API.  Only trusted domains are permitted to make cross-origin requests.
*   **Configuration Flexibility:**  Using an environment variable makes it easy to change the allowed origins without modifying the code.  This is particularly useful for deploying the API in different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
*   **Security Best Practice:**  Restricting CORS origins is a fundamental security best practice for web APIs.

**How to use:**

1.  **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.**  For example, in a `.env` file or through your deployment platform's configuration. For instance, you might set it to:

    ```
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.example.com,https://api.example.com
    ```

2.  **Run your FastAPI application.**  The `os.environ.get()` function will read the environment variable and configure the CORS middleware accordingly.

This improvement adds a critical layer of security to your FastAPI application by limiting the potential for malicious cross-origin requests.  This is a much better approach than allowing all origins.
