## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Check for the existence of the VERSION environment variable, preventing potential issues if it's missing.
    version = os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0") # Use a default value if the environment variable is not set
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == version

```

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The original code directly used a hardcoded string `"1.0.0"` for the `version` in the health check assertion.  This is problematic because:

1.  **Hardcoded values are inflexible:**  If the version of your application changes, you have to manually update the test code.  This increases the risk of the test and the application getting out of sync.
2.  **Potential for misconfiguration:** Your application's actual version might be configured elsewhere (e.g., in a Dockerfile, environment variable, or configuration file).  If these configurations disagree, your tests will fail unpredictably and not properly reflect the deployed version.
3. **Security Implications:** While seemingly minor, consistently reflecting the deployed version is important for security audits and vulnerability tracking.

To address this, the corrected code retrieves the version from an environment variable `VERSION` using `os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0")`.

*   **Using Environment Variables:** Environment variables are a standard way to configure applications and tests without embedding sensitive information or hardcoded values directly into the code.  They are easily set in CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration systems (like Kubernetes), or on the command line.

*   **`os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0")`:**  This is the key change. It tries to read the `VERSION` environment variable. If the variable *is not* set, it provides a default value of `"1.0.0"`.  This handles the case where the environment variable is not defined during testing (e.g., when running locally without explicitly setting it).

**Benefits of this change:**

*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  The test now adapts to the configured version of the application.  You can change the `VERSION` environment variable to match the deployed version, and the test will automatically adapt.
*   **Reduced Risk of Misconfiguration:**  The test is more likely to accurately reflect the actual version deployed to production.
*   **Improved Maintainability:**  You only need to update the `VERSION` environment variable when the application version changes, rather than modifying the test code itself.
* **Better Security:** Makes version tracking in test and application deployment more consistent and reliable.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Set the `VERSION` environment variable:**  Before running the tests, set the environment variable.  For example:

    ```bash
    export VERSION="1.2.3"  # In a Unix-like shell
    ```

    Or, in a Windows command prompt:

    ```
    set VERSION=1.2.3
    ```

2.  **Run the tests:**  Run your pytest command as usual.  The test will now use the value from the `VERSION` environment variable.

This single change improves the reliability, maintainability, and security of the test suite.
