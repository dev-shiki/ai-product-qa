**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Establish Clear Module Structure:** While 21 files isn't huge, ensure `app` is a proper Python package with a clear module structure. This helps with imports and code organization. Enforce consistent naming conventions across files (e.g., `queries.py` vs. `products.py`).

2. **Enforce consistent coding style:** Use a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` to enforce PEP 8 and other style guidelines across all files. This improves readability and maintainability, making collaboration easier. Integrate this into your testing process.
