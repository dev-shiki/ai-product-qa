## Quick Insights

Given the project structure (app directory with main.py and models), consider these improvements:

1. **Centralized Configuration:** Implement a configuration file (e.g., using `configparser` or `pydantic`) to manage application settings. This avoids hardcoding values directly in your code and makes environment-specific adjustments easier.

2. **Code Linting/Formatting:** Enforce code style consistency. Integrate a linter (like `flake8`) and a formatter (like `black`) into your development workflow to catch potential errors early and ensure code readability. This improves collaboration and maintainability.
