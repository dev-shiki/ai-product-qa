**Security Improvement:**

The hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` is replaced with an environment variable lookup:

```python
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Problem:** Storing the API base URL directly in the code (hardcoding) exposes it.  If the URL needs to change (e.g., from a development server to a production server), the code has to be modified and redeployed.  More critically, if the code is stored in a public repository or accidentally exposed, the API URL becomes visible, potentially giving attackers information about the application's backend.

*   **Solution:** Use an environment variable (`API_BASE_URL`). Environment variables are configuration values that are set outside of the application's code.  This is best practice for managing sensitive information, and configuration values that change between environments (development, staging, production).

*   **How it works:**

    *   `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`: This line attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable named "API_BASE_URL".
    *   If the environment variable "API_BASE_URL" is set, its value is assigned to the `API_BASE_URL` variable in the code.
    *   If the environment variable "API_BASE_URL" is *not* set, the second argument `"http://localhost:8000"` is used as a default value.  This provides a fallback in cases where the environment variable is not configured.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Security:**  The API base URL is not stored directly in the code, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
    *   **Flexibility:**  The API base URL can be changed easily without modifying the code.  This is especially useful for deploying the application to different environments (development, testing, production). You simply set the environment variable appropriately for each environment.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Environment variables are a standard way to configure applications, making the application more portable and easier to manage.

**How to set the environment variable:**

The method for setting environment variables depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  Here are some common examples:

*   **Linux/macOS:**

    *   In your terminal: `export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"`
    *   To make it permanent (add to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent file): `echo 'export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"' >> ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate file)

*   **Windows:**

    *   In the command prompt: `set API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com`
    *   To make it permanent (using the GUI): Search for "environment variables" in the Start menu, edit the System environment variables, and add or modify the `API_BASE_URL` variable.

*   **Cloud Platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud):**  Each platform provides its own mechanisms for setting environment variables.  Consult the platform's documentation.

Using environment variables is a fundamental security best practice for modern application development.  This change is a simple yet effective improvement to the security of your application.
