## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
    assert "Invalid API Key" in str(excinfo.value) # added error msg assertion
```

**Reasoning for Improvement:**

The original `test_settings_invalid` only checked if a `ValueError` was raised.  However, it didn't verify *why* the `ValueError` was raised.  This is important because a `ValueError` could be raised for various reasons, and we want to ensure it's specifically due to an invalid API key (as defined by the application's logic).

The improved code adds an assertion to check the error message contained within the `ValueError` exception.  Specifically, `assert "Invalid API Key" in str(excinfo.value)` checks that the exception message (converted to a string) contains the substring "Invalid API Key".

**Benefits of this Improvement:**

* **More Specific Testing:**  Ensures that the test is verifying the *correct* error condition.  It's no longer just checking for *any* `ValueError`.
* **Increased Confidence:**  Provides more confidence that the application's validation logic for the API key is working as intended.
* **Better Debugging:**  If the test fails, the assertion will give a more informative error message, indicating that the invalid API key validation logic might be faulty or the expected error message has changed.
* **Robustness:** Protects against unexpected side effects. If for any reason, the `Settings` constructor starts raising `ValueError` for a completely unrelated reason (e.g., a bad file path), this test would fail and alert developers to investigate the unexpected behavior.

**Assumptions:**

* The `config.Settings` class is designed to raise a `ValueError` with a message including "Invalid API Key" when the provided API key is considered invalid by the application.  You'll need to adjust the assertion if the actual error message is different.
* This improvement focuses solely on enhancing the error handling verification in the provided test.  It does not address potential improvements within the `config.Settings` class itself.
