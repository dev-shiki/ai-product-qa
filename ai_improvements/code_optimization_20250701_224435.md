## Improvement

**Optimization:**

Memoize the imported `config` module.

**Improved Code Snippet (Conceptual):**

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

_config = None

def _get_config():
    global _config
    if _config is None:
        from app.utils import config
        _config = config
    return _config

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env

    config = _get_config() # Use the memoized config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    config = _get_config() # Use the memoized config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
```

**Explanation:**

The original code imports `app.utils.config` in each test function.  Importing a module, especially one that might perform initialization logic, can be relatively slow.  By memoizing the imported module (storing it in a global variable `_config` and only importing if it's not already imported), we ensure that `app.utils.config` is imported only once across all the tests that use it.  Subsequent calls to `_get_config()` will simply return the already imported module.  This can reduce the overall test execution time, especially if the `config` module has expensive import-time dependencies or logic.

**Important Note:**
This optimization makes sense if the module `app.utils.config` is expensive to import, and if the module's state (e.g., global variables) doesn't need to be reset between tests. Also, the current proposed solution needs to consider thread safety aspects, and it could be done more clearly.

The best way to measure is to actually time the execution with and without the memoization to see if it provides a significant improvement.  If the import is fast, this optimization might be negligible or even add a small overhead.
