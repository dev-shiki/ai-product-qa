## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions for improving your Python project:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** Integrate a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` to enforce consistent coding style across all files. Pair this with a formatter like `black` or `autopep8` for automatic code formatting. This enhances readability and maintainability, reducing the risk of errors and making collaboration easier.

2.  **Improve test coverage reporting:** Utilize a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage and identify untested parts of your code. Aim for a reasonable coverage target (e.g., 80%) to ensure core functionality is well-tested and to catch regressions early.
