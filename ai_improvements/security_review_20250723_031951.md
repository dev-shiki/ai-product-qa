    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)

            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)

**Explanation:**

The core security improvement is to add **logging** to the error handling in `test_search_products_error`.  Currently, the code catches the exception but doesn't record any information about it. This makes debugging and auditing much harder.

Here's why this is a security improvement:

*   **Auditing and Monitoring:** By logging errors, you can track the frequency and types of failures. This helps identify potential attacks or vulnerabilities.  For example, if `search_products` is failing frequently with a specific error message, it might indicate a denial-of-service attempt or a flaw in the underlying search logic.
*   **Debugging:**  When errors occur, logs provide valuable context. You can see the parameters that were passed to the function, the state of the system at the time of the error, and the full traceback.  This makes it much easier to diagnose the root cause of the problem.
*   **Incident Response:** In the event of a security incident, logs are crucial for understanding what happened, how the attacker gained access, and what data was affected.
*   **Error Suppression/Masking:** By not logging errors, you risk masking important issues that could lead to security vulnerabilities being exploited.

**How the change addresses the vulnerability:**

The added `logger.exception("Error during search_products")` ensures that whenever an exception occurs during the `search_products` call, a detailed log message is created, including the exception type, message, and stack trace.  This information can then be used to monitor the system, identify potential problems, and respond to security incidents.

While the test case itself is not directly exploitable, improving error handling and logging is a fundamental security principle that makes the overall system more robust and easier to defend. Properly configured logging enables you to detect and respond to suspicious activity more effectively.  This change promotes a "defense-in-depth" security strategy.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Logging Levels:**  Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`) based on the severity of the event.
*   **Log Rotation:**  Configure log rotation to prevent logs from growing indefinitely and filling up disk space.
*   **Log Security:**  Protect log files from unauthorized access.  Logs can contain sensitive information, so it's important to restrict access to authorized personnel only.  Consider encrypting logs at rest.
*   **Centralized Logging:**  Send logs to a central logging server for easier analysis and monitoring. Tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, or Sumo Logic can be used for this purpose.
*   **Data Minimization:** Avoid logging sensitive data directly. If you must log sensitive data, consider redacting or masking it.
