**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The primary security improvement is the addition of **input sanitization** using the `bleach` library.  Specifically, I've addressed a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `search_products` and `get_products` methods.

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** If the `keyword` or `search` parameters passed to these methods are directly used without sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.  This code could then be executed in the user's browser, potentially stealing sensitive information or performing actions on the user's behalf.

*   **Bleach Sanitization:** `bleach` is a library designed to sanitize HTML markup and text. It removes potentially dangerous HTML tags, attributes, and styles, preventing XSS attacks.  It's crucial when accepting user-provided input and displaying it within your application.

*   **Implementation:**

    1.  **Import `bleach`:**  `import bleach` is added at the top of the file.
    2.  **Sanitize `keyword` in `search_products`:** The `keyword` parameter is sanitized using `sanitized_keyword = bleach.clean(keyword)` before being used in the search query and logging messages.
    3.  **Sanitize `search` in `get_products`:** The `search` parameter is sanitized using `sanitized_search = bleach.clean(search)` before passing it to the `search_products` method.

By sanitizing these inputs, we ensure that any potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code is removed, making the application more secure against XSS attacks.  This helps protect users from having their accounts compromised or experiencing other security breaches.

**Why this is the most impactful improvement:**

XSS vulnerabilities are a common and serious web security risk. Sanitizing user input, especially data used in search queries or displayed in the user interface, is a critical defense mechanism. While other improvements are possible (e.g., rate limiting), XSS prevention directly addresses a prevalent attack vector.
