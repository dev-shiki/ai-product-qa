## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService
import logging

# Configure logging (optional, but good practice)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Or logging.DEBUG

@pytest.fixture
def mock_local_service():
    return MagicMock()

@pytest.fixture
def product_service(mock_local_service):
    service = ProductDataService()
    service.local_service = mock_local_service
    return service

class TestProductDataService:
    
    def test_init(self, product_service):
        """Test ProductDataService initialization"""
        assert product_service.local_service is not None
        assert isinstance(product_service.local_service, MagicMock)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_success(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test successful product search"""
        mock_products = [
            {"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max", "price": 21999000}
        ]
        mock_local_service.search_products.return_value = mock_products
        
        result = await product_service.search_products("iPhone", 5)
        
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in result)
        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("iPhone", 5)
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_search_products_error(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test product search with error"""
        mock_local_service.search_products.side_effect = Exception("Test error")
        
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error"):
            await product_service.search_products("test", 5)

        mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("test", 5)  # Verify the call happened

    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_get_products_with_search(self, product_service, mock_local_service):
        """Test get_products with search parameter"""
        mock_products = [{"id": "P001", "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max"}]

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`pytest.raises` Context Manager:**  Instead of catching the exception and returning an empty list, the `test_search_products_error` test now uses `pytest.raises`. This is the *correct* way to test that a specific exception is raised when it's *supposed* to be.

* **`with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error"):`**: This does several important things:
    * **`pytest.raises(Exception)`**:  It asserts that the code within the `with` block will raise an `Exception`.  This is more specific than just asserting *any* exception is raised.
    * **`match="Test error"`**:  It *further* asserts that the exception's message contains the string "Test error".  This makes the test very precise.  You should always match the exception message when possible to avoid false positives (where the test passes because some *other* exception was raised).  If you didn't include this, a different exception could cause the test to pass, masking the real problem.

* **`mock_local_service.search_products.assert_called_once_with("test", 5)`**:  This line is crucial.  It ensures that even though the `search_products` method raised an exception, it was still *called* with the expected arguments.  This verifies that the exception happened *after* the call, not before.  It adds confidence that the logic is correct.

* **Removed unnecessary `try...except` and `assert result == []`**:  The `pytest.raises` context manager *replaces* the need for manual exception handling and asserting an empty list result. The test now focuses on verifying the exception is raised as expected.

* **Logging (Optional but Recommended):** The original code had no logging.  While not strictly *error handling*, logging is essential for debugging and understanding application behavior, especially in production.  The added `logging.basicConfig` line enables basic logging to the console.  Within the `ProductDataService` itself (not shown here, as the prompt was to improve error handling only in the *test*), you should add `logger.exception` calls inside `except` blocks to log the full traceback of the error.

Why this is better:

1. **Accurate Exception Testing:** The `pytest.raises` context manager is the standard and correct way to assert that an exception is raised.
2. **Specific Assertion:** Matching the exception message (using `match=`) makes the test more robust and avoids false positives.
3. **Call Verification:** `assert_called_once_with` ensures the mocked function was actually called before the exception occurred, proving the code execution path.
4. **Test Clarity:**  The test code is much cleaner and more focused on the expected behavior (the exception).
5. **Improved Debugging:** If the test fails, the `pytest.raises` output will clearly indicate that the expected exception was not raised, or the exception message didn't match, making debugging much easier.
6. **Real-world Relevance:**  This approach is how you should test for exceptions in real-world applications. You want to ensure that the correct exception is raised under specific circumstances.

How to integrate logging into the actual `ProductDataService` (example):

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # Get a logger for this module

class ProductDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.local_service = LocalProductService() #Or however it's injected

    async def search_products(self, query, limit):
        try:
            return await self.local_service.search_products(query, limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products: {e}")  # Log the exception traceback
            return []  # Or re-raise, depending on your needs
```

By logging the exception, you get a detailed record of what went wrong, which is invaluable for troubleshooting.  If you *re-raise* the exception, the caller gets notified of the error.  The best approach depends on your application's error handling strategy.
