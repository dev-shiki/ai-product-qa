# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 04:09:06  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider a more structured project layout:** With 21 Python files, the `app` directory might be getting unwieldy. Explore subdirectories within `app` (e.g., `app/services`, `app/utils`) to group related files and improve code organization.

2.  **Implement CI/CD:**  Setting up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI would automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and faster release cycles. The 8 test files are a good foundation for this.
