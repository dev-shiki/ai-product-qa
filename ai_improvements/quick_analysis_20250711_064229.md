**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure with 21 Python files and 8 test files, and the presence of an `api` subdirectory, here are two quick suggestions:

1.  **Implement a consistent coding style using a linter and formatter:** Use tools like `flake8` or `pylint` for linting and `black` for formatting.  This promotes readability and maintainability across all files. Integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Enforce code coverage:** Use a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to measure how much of your code is covered by tests. Aim for a reasonable coverage target (e.g., 80%+) to ensure sufficient test coverage and minimize potential regressions.
