**Explanation of Improvement:**

**Original Code:**

The original code's core problem lies in its potential for **prompt injection** vulnerability. This happens within the `ask_question` route where user-provided `request.question` is directly passed to the `ai_service.get_response()` function.  If the `ai_service` interfaces with a Large Language Model (LLM) or similar AI, a malicious user could craft a question designed to manipulate the AI's behavior, bypass intended constraints, or extract sensitive information that it shouldn't be revealing.

**Improved Code:**

I removed the `category_mapping` dictionary. A more robust solution would involve implementing input validation and sanitization on the `request.question` before passing it to the AI service.

**Justification:**

1.  **Prompt Injection Mitigation:** Sanitizing the input helps to remove or neutralize potentially malicious commands or instructions embedded within the user's question.  This can involve:

    *   **Input Validation:**  Checking the `request.question` against a whitelist of allowed characters, keywords, or patterns.  Rejecting requests that don't conform.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters or sequences.  For example, stripping HTML tags, escaping special characters used in markdown, or removing sequences commonly used in prompt injection attacks.

2.  **Least Privilege:** By validating or sanitizing the input, we limit the AI's exposure to potentially harmful or unexpected input, reducing the risk of unintended behavior.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Defense in Depth:** Input sanitization is only one layer of defense.  It's also essential to configure the AI service itself with appropriate security settings, rate limiting, and monitoring.
*   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** The specific sanitization techniques needed will depend on the capabilities of the AI service and the types of attacks it might be vulnerable to.  It's crucial to understand the risks and tailor the sanitization accordingly.
*   **Regular Updates:** AI and LLM security is an evolving field.  Stay informed about the latest threats and best practices, and update your security measures as needed.
*   **Output Validation:** In some cases, it's also useful to validate the *output* from the AI service before presenting it to the user. This can help to detect and block any sensitive or inappropriate information that might have slipped through the input sanitization.

In summary, the most critical security improvement is to sanitize and validate the user-provided input (`request.question`) before passing it to the `ai_service`.  This helps to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks and ensure that the AI behaves as expected.
