## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

# Configure logging (adjust level as needed)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    """
    Tests the /api/products/ endpoint.  Includes logging.
    """
    logger.info("Starting test_get_products")

    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    logger.info("Mock service configured.")

    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logger.info("Sending GET request to /api/products/")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
        logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")

    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logger.info(f"Response data: {data}")

    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)
    logger.info("All assertions passed.")
    logger.info("Finished test_get_products")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Logging Setup:**  The code now includes a basic logging configuration using `logging.basicConfig`.  This is crucial.  Without it, the `logger.info` calls won't output anything.  The `level=logging.INFO` setting means that `INFO` level and above messages (e.g., `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) will be displayed.  You can adjust this level to `logging.DEBUG` for much more detailed output, or `logging.WARNING` to only see warnings/errors.  Critically, this happens *outside* the function, making it run only once at the start of the script.
* **Informative Log Messages:** The log messages now provide context at each stage of the test:
    * "Starting test_get_products":  Indicates when the test begins.
    * "Mock service configured.": Confirms that the mock service is set up.
    * "Sending GET request to /api/products/":  Shows that the HTTP request is being sent.
    * "Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}":  Logs the HTTP status code, which is essential for debugging failures.
    * "Response data: {data}":  Logs the actual JSON response data, allowing you to inspect the returned values.  Use with caution for large responses, as logging can become noisy.  Consider limiting the amount of data logged in production or using a more structured logging format.
    * "All assertions passed.":  Confirms that the assertions in the test have passed.
    * "Finished test_get_products": Indicates the end of the test.
* **f-strings:** Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}"`) makes it much easier to embed variable values into log messages.
* **Error Handling Considerations (Important):** While this adds logging, a real-world scenario would also benefit from `try...except` blocks *within* the function to catch potential exceptions and log them as errors.  This is especially true when dealing with external services or network requests.  For example:

```python
try:
    resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
    logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"An error occurred during the request: {e}", exc_info=True) #exc_info=True provides stack trace
    raise #Re-raise the exception to fail the test

```

   The `exc_info=True` argument to `logger.error` is *critical* because it includes the full traceback of the exception, which is invaluable for debugging.  Reraising the exception ensures that the test still fails if an error occurs.  Without it, the test might silently pass even though something went wrong.  The use of `try...except` is much better than just `assert resp.status_code == 200` because it handles *unexpected* errors (like network connectivity problems).

* **Readability:**  I've added comments to explain what each section of the code does.
* **Placement:** Log statements are strategically placed to provide a clear execution flow.

This revised solution provides much more valuable logging for debugging and monitoring your tests. Remember to adjust the logging level and format as needed for your specific environment.
