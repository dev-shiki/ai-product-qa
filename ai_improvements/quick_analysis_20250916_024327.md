## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:** Move configuration loading logic (likely in `app/utils/config.py`) to a more centralized location (e.g., a dedicated `config` package under the root directory).  This improves maintainability and allows easier environment-specific configurations.

2. **Test Discovery:**  Consider using a dedicated testing framework (pytest or unittest with auto-discovery) if you aren't already. This simplifies test execution and ensures all tests are run automatically.  This is especially helpful with multiple test files (8).
