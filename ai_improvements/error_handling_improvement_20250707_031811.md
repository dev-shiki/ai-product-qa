## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
    assert "Invalid Google API Key" in str(excinfo.value) #Improved error handling
```

**Reasoning for Improvement:**

The original code for `test_settings_invalid` only checked that a `ValueError` was raised.  This is a weak test.  We don't know *why* the `ValueError` was raised.  It could be a completely unrelated reason, and the test would still pass, giving a false sense of security.

The improved code adds the following:

1. **`as excinfo`:** This captures the exception information when `pytest.raises` detects a `ValueError`.
2. **`assert "Invalid Google API Key" in str(excinfo.value)`:** This is the key improvement.  It checks that the *specific error message* within the raised `ValueError` contains the string "Invalid Google API Key".  This ensures that the `ValueError` is actually being raised because the Google API key is invalid, and not some other reason.  You should replace `"Invalid Google API Key"` with a string that accurately reflects the expected error message your `config.Settings` class will raise when the API key is invalid.  This is far more robust than simply checking for the type of exception.

This approach provides much better error handling in the test:

* **Specificity:**  It verifies the specific reason for the failure.
* **Readability:**  It makes the test intent clearer.  It is immediately obvious what the test is checking for.
* **Maintainability:**  If the error message in `config.Settings` changes slightly, this test will now fail, alerting you to the need to update the test to match the new error message.  The original test would have silently continued to pass.

In summary, by checking the content of the exception message, we've made the test much more specific, reliable, and useful for catching real problems.
