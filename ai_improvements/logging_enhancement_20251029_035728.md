# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/models/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 03:57:28  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging statements to. I need the code of the function to be able to modify it.

For example, if you provide:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y
```

I can return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of addition: {result}")
  return result
```

**Explanation of the logging added:**

*   **`import logging`**: Imports the `logging` module.
*   **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`**:  Configures the basic logging setup.  `level=logging.INFO` means that log messages with a severity of INFO or higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be displayed. You can adjust the level as needed (e.g., `logging.DEBUG` for more detailed logs). It is generally recommended to configure the logging module at the start of the main program.
*   **`logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")`**: Logs an informational message before the addition operation, showing the input values.  Uses an f-string for easy variable insertion.
*   **`logging.info(f"Result of addition: {result}")`**: Logs the result of the addition.

**How to use it:**

1.  Copy the modified function into your code.
2.  Make sure you have `import logging` at the top of your file.
3.  Run your code.  You should see log messages printed to your console.
