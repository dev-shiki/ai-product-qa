```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword}")
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword}")
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword '{keyword}': {str(e)}")  # Changed to logger.exception
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
            else:
                return self.get_all_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting products (limit={limit}, category={category}, search={search}): {str(e)}")  # Changed to logger.exception and added context
            try:  # Add a try-except block around the fallback call
                return self.local_service.get_products(limit)
            except Exception as fallback_e:
                logger.exception(f"Error during fallback to local_service.get_products(limit={limit}): {str(fallback_e)}") # Log any errors during fallback
                return [] # Return an empty list instead of rasing the exception
    
    async def get_categories(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get available categories"""
        try:
            return self.local_service.get_categories()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting categories: {str(e)}") # Changed to logger.exception
            return []

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception()` instead of `logger.error()`:**  The most critical change. `logger.exception()` logs the error message *and* the full traceback.  This is essential for debugging.  Without the traceback, you often only see the high-level error message, making it very difficult to pinpoint the root cause.  This is applied in all the `except` blocks.
* **Added context to error messages:** The error messages in `get_products` now include the values of `limit`, `category`, and `search`. This makes it much easier to understand the circumstances that led to the error.  For example, knowing the specific `keyword` that caused `search_products` to fail is very helpful.
* **Error Handling during Fallback in `get_products`:** The original code had a potential problem: if `self.local_service.get_products(limit)` raised an exception, that exception would be uncaught and would crash the application.  The improved code now wraps the fallback call in a `try...except` block and logs any errors encountered during the fallback. This prevents the unhandled exception and provides valuable information about why the fallback failed.  Critically, it now returns an empty list if the fallback also fails, ensuring that the application doesn't crash.
* **Consistent return value in case of failures:**  In all the `except` blocks, the function now returns an empty list (`[]`). This is a more robust approach than potentially raising an exception from within the `except` block.  Returning a consistent empty list allows the calling code to handle the failure gracefully.  Raising an exception would just move the problem up the call stack, potentially leading to more crashes.

These changes greatly improve the robustness and debuggability of the code.  When an error occurs, you'll now have a full traceback and contextual information, making it much easier to understand and fix the problem. The added try-except during fallback to local service prevents unhandled exceptions and promotes resilient behavior.
