## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Test response"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        assert response == "Test response"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_error():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_generate.side_effect = Exception("API Error")
        
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="API Error"): #Improved error handling
            await service.get_response("Test question")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_empty_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("")
        assert "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_long_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        long_question = "A" * 1000
        response = await service.get_response(long_question)
        assert "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_special_characters():
    service = AIService()
... (truncated for analysis)

**Reasoning for the change:**

The original `test_get_response_with_error` test was flawed.  It mocked an exception being raised by `generate_content`, but then proceeded to assert that the `get_response` function returned a specific string: `"Maaf, saya sedang mengalami kesulitan"`.  This implies that the `get_response` function *catches* the exception and returns a fallback message.  However, the provided code doesn't show what `get_response` does.

The improved version uses `pytest.raises` as a context manager to assert that an exception is *actually* raised by the `get_response` function when the mocked `generate_content` call raises an exception. Crucially, we check the exception message to ensure the correct exception is raised.  This is much more robust testing of what the function *should* do when an API error occurs.

Here's why this is better:

1. **Correctly Tests Error Handling:**  It directly tests if the exception is raised as expected, instead of assuming a specific fallback behavior.
2. **More Robust:** It checks the type and message of the exception.  The original code only checked if a substring was present in the returned value, which could lead to false positives if some *other* error also resulted in a similar string.
3. **Clearer Intent:**  `pytest.raises` clearly communicates the intention of the test: to verify that a specific exception is raised.
4. **Avoids Masking Errors:** If the `get_response` function doesn't actually raise the exception, this test will *fail*. The original test would silently pass, potentially hiding a bug where the exception is being swallowed unintentionally.

This change ensures that the test accurately verifies the error handling behavior of the `get_response` function.  It's important to note that I'm assuming that `AIService.get_response` should not catch this exception, and the exception should propagate.  If it's intended that `AIService.get_response` catches and handles the exception, then the assertion would need to be changed accordingly.  However, without seeing the `AIService.get_response` source code, this approach is the most generally correct.
