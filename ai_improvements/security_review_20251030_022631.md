## Improvement

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime
import time
import os  # Import the os module

# Configuration
# Use environment variables for sensitive configuration like API keys and URLs.
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000") #default to local if env variable not found.

def main():
    st.set_page_config(
        page_title="Product Assistant",
        page_icon="🛍️",
        layout="wide",
        initial_sidebar_state="expanded"

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The core security improvement is replacing the hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` with an environment variable lookup:

```python
API_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
```

**Why this is important:**

* **Prevents Hardcoding Sensitive Information:** Hardcoding API keys, URLs, or other sensitive configuration data directly in your code is a major security risk. If your code is committed to a public repository (even accidentally), this information becomes exposed.
* **Configuration Flexibility:** Environment variables allow you to configure your application differently for development, testing, and production environments without modifying the code itself.  This is crucial for deploying to different environments where the API might be hosted at different locations.
* **Security Best Practice:** Using environment variables is a widely recognized best practice for managing configuration in applications, particularly when dealing with sensitive data.
* **Easier Management:** Environment variables are managed at the operating system level (or through container orchestration systems like Docker Compose or Kubernetes). This allows you to change the configuration without redeploying your application.

**How it works:**

1. **`os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`:**
   - `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL")` attempts to retrieve the value of the environment variable named "API_BASE_URL".
   - If the environment variable is found, its value is assigned to `API_BASE_URL`.
   - If the environment variable is *not* found, the second argument, `"http://localhost:8000"`, is used as the *default* value.  This is useful for local development where you might not have set the environment variable.

**How to set the environment variable (example):**

* **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"
   ```

* **Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```cmd
   set API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api.com
   ```

* **Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```powershell
   $env:API_BASE_URL = "https://your-production-api.com"
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Never commit sensitive information to your repository.**  Ensure that your `.gitignore` file includes files that might contain environment variable definitions or other sensitive information (e.g., `.env` files).
* **Use secure methods for storing and managing environment variables in production.**  Consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
* **Sanitize and validate any user input before sending it to the backend API.** This code snippet doesn't show user input, but it's a general security best practice.
