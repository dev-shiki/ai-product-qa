## Quick Insights

Given the project size, consider these two improvements:

1.  **Enforce code style:** Use a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` across all files (including tests) to ensure consistent code formatting and identify potential errors early. This enhances readability and maintainability.

2.  **Implement a consistent testing strategy:** Analyze your test files. Are you aiming for specific coverage goals?  Adopt a consistent testing framework (e.g., `pytest`) and structure your tests to target core functionalities, especially around your models.  Consider using a testing framework that includes code coverage reporting.
