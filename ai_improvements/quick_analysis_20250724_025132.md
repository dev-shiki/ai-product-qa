# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:51:32  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Consider adding type hints and a linter/formatter:**  Adding type hints (using `mypy`) will improve code readability and catch potential errors early. Integrating a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black` or `autopep8`) will enforce code style consistency across all files, making the codebase more maintainable.

2.  **Evaluate test coverage:** 8 test files for 21 Python files might indicate insufficient test coverage.  Assess which areas of your code are not being thoroughly tested. Aim for high coverage, especially for crucial parts like the `models` package (since it handles data).  Consider tools like `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage.
