## Quick Insights

1. **Implement Dependency Injection:** Currently, your `main.py`, `queries.py`, and `products.py` might be tightly coupled. Use a dependency injection framework or manual injection to improve testability and reduce dependencies between modules. This makes it easier to mock dependencies in tests and promotes code reusability.

2. **Enhance Test Coverage:** With 8 test files for 21 Python files, consider reviewing code coverage. Target at least 80% coverage focusing on critical logic and edge cases. Use tools like `pytest-cov` to identify untested areas and write more comprehensive unit/integration tests.
