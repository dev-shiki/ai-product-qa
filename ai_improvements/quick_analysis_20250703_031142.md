## Quick Insights

Given the structure (app/main.py, app/api/products.py), consider using a structured project layout with a `src` directory. Moving your main application code into `src/app` allows for better separation of concerns and avoids potential import issues when testing.

Also, analyze your test coverage. With 8 test files and 21 source files, ensuring good test coverage across all critical functionalities is crucial. Use a coverage tool like `pytest-cov` to identify areas with low coverage and prioritize writing tests for those sections.
