## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])  # Secure: Use environment variable
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])  # Secure: Use environment variable

```

**Explanation of Improvement:**

The security improvement is to replace hardcoded API key values within the `config.Settings` initialization with retrieval from the environment variable `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]`.

**Why this is more secure:**

*   **Avoids Hardcoding Sensitive Data:** Hardcoding API keys or other sensitive information directly in the code is a major security risk.  If the code is committed to a version control system (like Git) and becomes public, the API key is exposed.

*   **Environment Variables for Configuration:**  Environment variables are the standard way to configure applications, especially in deployment environments.  They allow you to set values without modifying the application's code. This makes it much easier to change keys without redeploying.

*   **Separation of Configuration from Code:** Keeping configuration separate from code reduces the risk of accidental exposure.  It also makes it easier to manage and update credentials independently.

**In Summary:**

By retrieving the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from the environment variable instead of hardcoding it in the tests, the code is now much more secure.  This prevents the accidental exposure of sensitive information in the codebase.
