# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./tests/test_config.py`  
**Time**: 03:18:19  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import os
import pytest
from unittest import mock
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def test_settings_valid(monkeypatch):
    logging.debug("Starting test_settings_valid")
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "dummy-key")
    logging.debug("Set GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable to 'dummy-key'")
    # Import after setting env
    from app.utils import config
    logging.debug("Imported app.utils.config")
    s = config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="dummy-key")
    logging.debug(f"Created Settings object: {s}")
    assert s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == "dummy-key"
    logging.debug("Assertion passed: s.GOOGLE_API_KEY == 'dummy-key'")
    assert s.API_PORT == 8000
    logging.debug("Assertion passed: s.API_PORT == 8000")
    logging.debug("Finished test_settings_valid")

def test_settings_invalid(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY", "your-google-api-key-here")
    from app.utils import config
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        config.Settings(GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key-here")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially, the `logging` module is now imported.
* **Basic Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` configures the logging system to output messages at the DEBUG level or higher.  This is essential to see the logs. You might want to use `logging.INFO` in production to reduce verbosity.
* **Clear Log Messages:** The log messages are now much more informative, indicating what's happening in each step of the function.  Using f-strings (`f"Created Settings object: {s}"`) allows you to include the *value* of variables in the logs, which is extremely helpful for debugging.
* **Placement of Logs:** The logging statements are strategically placed to track the flow of execution and the values of key variables.
* **`logging.debug`:**  `logging.debug` is used, as it is the most appropriate level for this kind of detailed tracing during development.
* **No changes to `test_settings_invalid`:** Only the requested function was modified.

This revised answer provides a fully functional and helpful logging implementation for the `test_settings_valid` function.  It addresses the original problem and includes best practices for logging in Python. Remember to adapt the logging level and output format for your specific needs.
