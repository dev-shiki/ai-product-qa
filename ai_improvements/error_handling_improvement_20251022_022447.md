Key improvements and explanations:

* **Explicit Exception Handling:**  The code now uses `try...except` blocks to specifically catch `TypeError`, `ValueError`, and a generic `Exception`.  This allows you to handle different error types in different ways.
* **Specific Exception Types:**  Instead of a general `except Exception:`, the code now catches `TypeError` and `ValueError` specifically.  This lets you handle data validation problems (e.g., wrong data type, missing fields, invalid values) separately from more general errors.
* **Informative Error Messages:**  The `raise` statements for `TypeError` and `ValueError` include informative messages that describe the specific problem.  This makes debugging much easier.  The error messages should contain the *context* of the error.  What values are invalid or missing? What data types were expected/received?  Include data context so you can debug the *data*, not just the code.
* **Logging:**  The `logging` module is used to record errors.  This is crucial for production environments, as it allows you to track errors without crashing the application and debug later.  Use `logger.error` for problems that *should not happen*.  Use `logger.exception` *only* inside an `except` block, as it automatically logs the full stack trace, which is extremely helpful for understanding the origin of the error.
* **Graceful Error Handling (Returning Errors Instead of Crashing):** Instead of letting the code crash, the `except` blocks return dictionaries containing error information. This allows the calling code to handle the error gracefully (e.g., display an error message to the user, retry the operation, or use a default value).  Returning error dictionaries is crucial, especially in a service-oriented architecture, as it allows calling components to react to problems instead of crashing.  The dictionaries include `"error"` (a human-readable error message) and `"details"` (the original exception's message, which may be more technical).
* **Example Usage:**  The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block provides example usage of the `process_data` function, including how to call it with valid and invalid data.  This makes it easy to test the error handling and see how it works. It demonstrates how the error messages are returned, and logs those error messages to the console.
* **Comprehensive Error Information:** The error messages returned include the type of error, the specific details of the error, and even the data that caused the error.  This helps you diagnose the problem quickly.
* **Clear Function Definition:**  The function has a clear docstring that explains what it does, what arguments it takes, what it returns, and what exceptions it might raise.

How to use this improved code:

1. **Adapt the `process_data` function:**  Modify the code within the `try` block to match the actual processing logic of your service.  Adjust the type checks and validation rules as needed.  Make sure to raise appropriate exceptions when errors occur.
2. **Configure Logging:** Set up the `logging` module to write logs to a file or other destination.  This is essential for production deployments.
3. **Call the function and handle errors:**  When you call `process_data`, check the return value.  If it's a dictionary and contains an "error" key, then an error occurred.  Handle the error appropriately.

This improved version prioritizes robustness, maintainability, and debuggability.  It provides a solid foundation for building reliable service modules.
