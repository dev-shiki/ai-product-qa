# Logging Enhancement

**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Okay, please provide the function you want me to add logging to.  I need the code of the function to be able to add the logging statements effectively.

For example, if you provided this:

```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together."""
  return x + y
```

I would return:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Configure logging (if not already configured)

def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers together."""
  logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")  # Log input values
  result = x + y
  logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is: {result}")  # Log the result
  return result
```

**Explanation of the Logging:**

*   **`import logging`:** Imports the logging module.
*   **`logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`:**  *If your application doesn't already have logging configured*, you'll want to add this (or a more sophisticated logging configuration).  This sets the basic logging level to `INFO`, meaning that `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages will be displayed.  You can change the level to `DEBUG` for more detailed logging during development.
*   **`logging.info(f"Adding {x} and {y}")`:** This logs an informational message at the start of the function, showing the input values. I'm using an f-string to make it easy to include the variables in the message.  Choose the appropriate logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) based on the severity/importance of the message.  `DEBUG` is most verbose.
*   **`result = x + y`:** The original calculation.
*   **`logging.info(f"Result of adding {x} and {y} is: {result}")`:** Logs the result of the addition.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Logging Level:** Choose the right logging level.  `DEBUG` is very detailed (use during development).  `INFO` is for general informational messages. `WARNING` is for potential problems.  `ERROR` is for actual errors. `CRITICAL` is for severe errors that might cause the application to crash.
*   **Logging Configuration:** For real applications, you'll want to configure logging more robustly (e.g., to write to files, use different formats, etc.).  The `logging.basicConfig()` call is a simple starting point.
*   **Performance:**  Excessive logging can impact performance, especially at high logging levels.  Be mindful of what you log and the frequency.
*   **Sensitive Data:**  **Never log sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or personal information.**

**Please provide the function you want me to add logging to, and I'll give you a more tailored response.**
