## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1. **Implement a linter and formatter:** Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to enforce consistent code style across all files. This reduces cognitive load when reading code and helps prevent common errors. Configure them to run automatically in your IDE or CI/CD pipeline.

2. **Improve test organization:** Group related tests together within test files (e.g., `test_product.py` for tests related to `product.py`). Use clear naming conventions for test functions/methods that indicate what they're testing. Consider utilizing fixtures for setup/teardown to avoid code duplication in your test suite.
