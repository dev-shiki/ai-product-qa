    Calculates the sum of two integers.

    Args:
        a: The first integer.
        b: The second integer.

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """
    logging.info(f"Calculating sum of {a} and {b}")  # Log input values
    try:
        result = a + b
        logging.info(f"Sum calculated: {result}")  # Log the result
        return result
    except TypeError as e:
        logging.error(f"TypeError occurred: {e}")  # Log any errors
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to propagate it
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")  # Log unexpected exceptions
        raise # Re-raise the exception to propagate it
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  Imports the necessary logging module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(...)`:**  *Crucially*, this sets up the basic logging configuration.  Without this, you won't see any log output.  `level=logging.INFO` means it will log messages at INFO level and above (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).  The `format` string specifies the format of the log messages. Adjust the level and format as needed for your application. You can configure much more sophisticated logging setups (e.g., writing to files, different log levels for different modules).
* **`logging.info(f"Calculating sum of {a} and {b}")`:** Logs the input values to the function.  This helps you track what the function is being called with.  Uses f-strings for clear formatting.
* **`logging.info(f"Sum calculated: {result}")`:** Logs the calculated result.
* **`try...except` blocks:** Handles potential errors.  `TypeError` is specifically handled in case `a` or `b` are not integers. A general `Exception` is also added to catch any unexpected issues.
* **`logging.error(f"TypeError occurred: {e}")`:** Logs the error message at the ERROR level.  Includes the exception object `e` for more details.
* **`logging.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")`:**  `logging.exception` is the *best* way to log exceptions.  It automatically includes the traceback, which is extremely valuable for debugging.  This catches any other unexpected exceptions.
* **`raise` (or `raise e`):**  Critically important.  After logging the error, *re-raise* the exception.  This allows the calling code to handle the error appropriately.  If you don't re-raise, the calling code will never know an error occurred, and your application might continue in an inconsistent state.  Simply logging and not re-raising *swallows* the error.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Uses f-strings for readable log messages. The logging messages are informative and explain what's happening.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Includes handling for `TypeError` specifically, as well as a general exception handler for unexpected errors.
* **Level Appropriate Logging:** Uses `logging.info` for normal operation, `logging.error` for errors, and `logging.exception` for unexpected exceptions with tracebacks.

How to run this:

```python
# In your main application:

import logging  # Make sure logging is imported

from your_module import calculate_sum  # Replace your_module

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
        print(f"The result is: {result}")

        calculate_sum("hello", 3) # This will cause a TypeError
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught a TypeError in main: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Caught a general exception in main: {e}")
```

Now, when you run your program, you'll see the log messages printed to the console (or wherever you've configured your logging to go).  And, importantly, any exceptions will be logged *and* re-raised, allowing your application to handle them gracefully. Remember to replace `your_module` with the actual name of your Python file.
