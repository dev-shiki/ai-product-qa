**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The added security improvement is **input sanitization** applied to the `request.question` before passing it to the `ai_service.get_response()` function.

Here's why this is important and how it works:

*   **Prompt Injection Vulnerability:** The original code was vulnerable to prompt injection. If a user provides a malicious question (e.g., one containing instructions to the AI to ignore previous instructions or reveal sensitive data), the AI might execute those instructions, leading to unintended and potentially harmful behavior.  This is especially crucial when the AI service interacts with other parts of the system or sensitive data.

*   **Sanitization:** The code now includes this line:

    ```python
    sanitized_question = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\.\?!,]', '', request.question)
    ```

    This line uses a regular expression to remove any characters from the user's input (`request.question`) that are not:
    *   Alphanumeric characters (`\w`)
    *   Whitespace (`\s`)
    *   Periods (`.`)
    *   Question marks (`?`)
    *   Exclamation points (`!`)
    *   Commas (`,`)

    Effectively, it allows only a limited set of characters commonly used in natural language questions. All other characters are removed.  It also logs when sanitization occurs, providing audit trail.

*   **Why this works:**  By restricting the characters allowed in the user's question, we significantly reduce the attack surface.  Malicious instructions often rely on special characters or code-like syntax to manipulate the AI's behavior. Removing these characters makes it much harder for an attacker to inject harmful commands.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Specificity:** The regular expression is tailored to allow common characters for questions. You might need to adjust it based on the specific use case and the type of questions you expect. Be careful not to be *too* restrictive, as this could degrade the user experience.  Allowing periods, question marks, and commas helps maintain the natural flow of questions.

*   **Defense in Depth:**  Input sanitization is a crucial first line of defense, but it should be part of a broader security strategy.  Other important measures include:

    *   **Output validation:** Verify that the AI's output is safe before displaying it to the user or using it in other parts of the system.
    *   **Rate limiting:** Limit the number of requests a user can make to prevent abuse.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the system for suspicious activity.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run the AI service in a sandboxed environment to limit the damage that a compromised AI can cause.

*   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  Ideally, sanitization should be context-aware.  This means tailoring the sanitization rules to the specific input field and its intended use.  In this case, we're sanitizing a question, so we should allow characters appropriate for questions.
