# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 01:55:05  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:** With 21 files, managing settings is likely spread out. Introduce a configuration file (e.g., using `configparser` or `python-dotenv`) to store database credentials, API keys, and other environment-specific variables. This improves maintainability and simplifies deployment across different environments.

2. **Consistent Logging:** Implement a centralized logging system (using the `logging` module) across all files. This will facilitate debugging and monitoring. Standardize log formats and levels for consistent tracking of application behavior. Configure logging to write to files or external services as needed.
