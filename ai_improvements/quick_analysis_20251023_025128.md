## Quick Insights

Given the structure with `app/main.py` and separate API modules, consider these two improvements:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Move configuration settings (database URLs, API keys) to a central configuration file (e.g., `config.py`). This improves maintainability and allows for easier environment-specific configurations using environment variables.

2.  **Dependency Injection:**  Instead of hardcoding dependencies within modules, use dependency injection to provide services (like database connections) to your API modules. This enhances testability by allowing you to easily mock dependencies in your test files.
