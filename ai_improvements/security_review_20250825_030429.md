**Explanation of the security improvement:**

The original code hardcoded the `API_BASE_URL`.  Hardcoding sensitive information like API endpoints, credentials, or secret keys directly into the code is a major security risk.  If the code is committed to a public repository or otherwise exposed, the API base URL becomes readily available to anyone. This allows an attacker to potentially interact directly with the API without authentication, bypass the Streamlit application, and possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the backend service.

The improved code addresses this by:

1. **Using Environment Variables:** It replaces the hardcoded value with `os.environ.get("API_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`. This retrieves the `API_BASE_URL` from an environment variable.
2. **Providing a Default Value:** The `os.environ.get()` method also includes a default value (`"http://localhost:8000"`). This ensures that the application still functions locally if the environment variable is not set, which is helpful for development.

**Why this is more secure:**

* **Separation of Configuration and Code:** Environment variables allow you to configure the application without modifying the code itself.  This means you can deploy the same code in different environments (development, staging, production) with different API endpoints, without having to change the codebase.
* **Reduced Risk of Exposure:** Environment variables are typically stored outside the codebase. This reduces the risk of accidentally committing sensitive information to a version control system.
* **Easier Management:** Environment variables can be easily managed and updated through the operating system or container orchestration platform.

**How to set the environment variable:**

The way you set the environment variable depends on your operating system and deployment environment.  Here are some examples:

* **Locally (Command Line):**
    * **Linux/macOS:** `export API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"`
    * **Windows:** `set API_BASE_URL="https://your-production-api.com"`
* **Docker:**  You can set environment variables in your `Dockerfile` or when running the container with the `-e` flag.
* **Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):** Each platform has its own way of managing environment variables for your applications. Refer to the platform's documentation.

By adopting this approach, you significantly improve the security of your application by preventing the exposure of sensitive configuration information.
