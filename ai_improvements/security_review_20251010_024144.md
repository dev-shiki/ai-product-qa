## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api import products, queries
from app.utils.config import settings
import os

app = FastAPI(
    title="Product Assistant",
    description="Smart product recommendation system",
    version="1.0.0"
)

# Accessing the allowed origins from environment variables.  If not found, deny all requests
ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR = os.getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "")
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR.split(",") if ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR else []


app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

app.include_router(products.router, prefix="/api/products", tags=["products"])
app.include_router(queries.router, prefix="/api/queries", tags=["queries"])

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The original code uses `allow_origins=["*"]` in the `CORSMiddleware`. This allows any origin to make requests to the API, which is a significant security risk.  It essentially disables CORS protection.  A malicious website could then make requests to your API on behalf of a user, potentially exposing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.

The improved code replaces `allow_origins=["*"]` with  `allow_origins=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.  It retrieves allowed origins from an environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.  If the environment variable is not set (or is empty), `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` defaults to an empty list, denying all cross-origin requests unless the browser explicitly disables CORS for the current context (which it usually does not).  This is the safest default behavior.  When the environment variable is set, the origins are split by commas, making it easy to specify multiple allowed origins.

**Why this is better:**

*   **Explicit Allowed Origins:** By explicitly defining the allowed origins, you limit the potential attack surface. Only trusted domains can access the API.
*   **Configuration via Environment Variables:** Using environment variables for configuration is best practice for managing sensitive information and simplifies deployment across different environments (development, staging, production).  It avoids hardcoding values directly into the code.
*   **Defense in Depth:** CORS is not a perfect security solution, but it provides a valuable layer of protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other browser-based attacks.

**How to use:**

1.  **Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.** For example, in a `.env` file:

    ```
    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.example.com,http://localhost:3000
    ```

2.  Make sure your deployment environment loads the environment variables.  If using Docker, you can pass the environment variable in the `docker run` command or a `docker-compose.yml` file.  If deploying to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), consult their documentation on setting environment variables for your application.

This change significantly improves the security posture of the API by restricting cross-origin requests to only trusted sources, defined through environment variables.
