```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
from functools import lru_cache

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = 20,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))


@router.get("/search")
async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Search products by query"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.search_products(query, limit)
        return {"products": products, "query": query, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@router.get("/top-rated")
async def get_top_rated_products(limit: Optional[int] = 10):
    """Get top rated products"""
    try:
        products = await product_service.get_top_rated_products(limit)
        return {"products": products, "source": "local"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

**Justification:**

The `get_categories` endpoint is likely to return the same categories most of the time.  By adding `@lru_cache(maxsize=None)` above the `get_categories` function, we are using memoization to cache the results of the function call.  `lru_cache` from `functools` automatically caches the return value of the function based on its arguments.  Since `get_categories` takes no arguments, it will cache the result of the first call, and subsequent calls will return the cached result directly, avoiding the need to call the `product_service.get_categories()` function again. `maxsize=None` means the cache can grow indefinitely, which is appropriate here as we assume the categories don't change frequently.  This can significantly improve performance, especially if `product_service.get_categories()` involves database queries or other expensive operations.  Note that the category is added before the route decorator.  This is important to ensure the caching applies to the route and not before that.

This approach assumes that the product categories do not change very often. If the categories are frequently updated, the cache invalidation strategy needs to be considered. For very dynamic category lists, caching might not be the best approach.  For this single improvement request, caching this function will provide the most benefit with the least changes to the original code.
