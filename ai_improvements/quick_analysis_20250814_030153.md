## Quick Insights

1. **Structure and Imports:** Group files logically within the `app` directory. Ensure consistent relative imports (`from . import ...`) to improve maintainability and avoid circular dependencies. Consider using an `__init__.py` in the `app` and `app/api` directories to make them explicit packages.

2. **Testing Coverage & Clarity:** Focus tests on critical functionality in `queries.py` and `products.py`. Aim for higher code coverage, particularly around complex logic.  Use descriptive test names and clear assertions to improve test readability and debuggability. Consider using pytest fixtures for common setup.
