```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The primary security risk addressed is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.  The original code, especially the `test_get_response_with_special_characters` test, highlights the vulnerability:  if the `AIService` doesn't properly sanitize user input, a malicious user could inject JavaScript code into the question, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

**Improvement:**

1.  **Input Sanitization/Validation:** The core addition is to emphasize the need for a `_sanitize_input` method within the `AIService` class (although its implementation is not actually provided here, the test assumes its existence).

2.  **Test Case for XSS Prevention:** A new test case `test_get_response_with_xss_attempt` simulates an XSS attack by providing a malicious script as input.  The test *patches* the `_sanitize_input` method.  The critical part is the assertion:  `assert "Pertanyaan mengandung karakter tidak valid" in response`. This asserts that if a malicious question is detected, the service responds appropriately, preventing the XSS attack.  It is not strictly required, but preferable for this test to patch the `_sanitize_input` method to validate it is even called.

**Crucial Implementation Detail (Not shown, but implied):**

The most important part (which this test *assumes*) is the `AIService` class must include an appropriate input sanitization or validation method. This would typically involve:

*   **Escaping HTML entities:** Replacing characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `"` with their corresponding HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, `&quot;`).
*   **Removing or encoding potentially malicious code:** Stripping out or encoding `<script>` tags, event handlers (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`), and other potentially harmful HTML attributes.
*   **Using a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a CSP header on your web server to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.  This is a defense-in-depth measure that can mitigate XSS attacks even if some input isn't perfectly sanitized.
*   **Validating input against a whitelist:**  If possible, define a whitelist of allowed characters or input patterns and reject any input that doesn't conform.

**Why this is important:**

Without input sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the AI service's responses. This code could then be executed in the browser of anyone viewing the response, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or deface the website.

This response assumes that the backend AI service has a method to sanitize input, and validates it has been called correctly in the provided test by mocking the relevant behavior.
