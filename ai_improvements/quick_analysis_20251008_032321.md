**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Centralized Configuration:** Consolidate settings (API keys, database URLs, feature flags) from individual files into a dedicated configuration module (e.g., `config.py`). This promotes easier management, modification, and deployment across all 21 Python files, eliminating scattered hardcoded values.

2. **Consistent Logging:** Implement a centralized logging system using Python's `logging` module. Standardize log levels, formats, and destinations (e.g., file, console) across the project. This will drastically improve debugging and monitoring of the application's behavior, especially valuable given the size and complexity.
