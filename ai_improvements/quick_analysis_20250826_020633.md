# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:06:33  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Introduce a linter and formatter (like Flake8 and Black).** With 21 files, code style consistency becomes crucial. Linters can catch potential errors and enforce coding standards, while formatters automate code formatting, improving readability and collaboration across the project.

2. **Implement basic type hinting.** While Python is dynamically typed, adding type hints, especially to function signatures in your API modules (queries.py, products.py), significantly enhances code clarity, allows for static analysis by tools like MyPy to catch potential type-related bugs early, and improves maintainability as the project grows.
