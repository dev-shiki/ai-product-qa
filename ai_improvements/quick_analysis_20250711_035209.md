**Time**: 03:52:09  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter:** With 21 Python files, consistent code style is crucial. Tools like Black (formatter) and Flake8 (linter) enforce style guidelines and catch common errors, improving readability and maintainability across the project.

2.  **Introduce a proper testing framework:** Having separate test files is good, but using a dedicated framework like pytest allows for better test discovery, fixture management, and clearer test organization. Consider using pytest-cov to track test coverage and identify areas needing more testing.
