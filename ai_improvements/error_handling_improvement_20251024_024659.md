## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/")
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to / failed: {e}") # Custom error message for clarity
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
            assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request to /health failed: {e}") # Custom error message for clarity
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Key improvements in error handling:

* **`response.raise_for_status()`**:  This is the most important addition. It checks the HTTP status code of the response.  If the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx), it raises an `httpx.HTTPStatusError` exception.  This is crucial for detecting and handling server-side problems or incorrect requests.

* **`try...except` blocks**:  The code is now wrapped in `try...except` blocks.  This allows us to catch potential exceptions that might occur during the request and assertion process.

* **Specific `HTTPStatusError` Handling**: The code specifically catches `HTTPStatusError` which is the exception `raise_for_status()` throws. This allows to create a meaningful fail message stating the HTTP error that was raised.

* **General `Exception` Handling**: The code has also a general `except Exception as e`: block. This will catch all other exceptions that might occur, ensuring the test doesn't just crash unexpectedly. This is good practice for robust testing.

* **`pytest.fail()` with informative messages**: Instead of letting exceptions bubble up (which can lead to less informative test failures), the code now uses `pytest.fail()` to explicitly mark the test as failed.  Crucially, the `pytest.fail()` calls include *descriptive error messages* that tell you exactly what went wrong (e.g., "Request to / failed: 404 Not Found").  This makes debugging much easier.

This revised code is much more robust because it explicitly handles potential errors, provides clear error messages, and prevents unexpected test crashes.
