## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def async_client():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
        yield client

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health(async_client):
    response = await async_client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
```

**Justification:**

The original code creates a new `AsyncClient` instance within each test function.  Creating and tearing down an `AsyncClient` involves establishing a new connection, which introduces overhead and slows down the tests.

The improved code introduces a pytest fixture called `async_client` with `scope="module"`.  This means the `AsyncClient` will be created **only once per test module** (i.e., per file). It then passes the client to each test function that requests it. This dramatically reduces the number of times a new connection needs to be established, leading to a significant performance improvement, especially when you have many tests hitting the same application.  The client will only be created once for the entire test file, improving performance.
