# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 08:01:52  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for the Python project:

1.  **Enhance Test Coverage & Structure:**  21 Python files with only 8 test files suggests potentially low test coverage. Aim for near 1:1 correspondence between feature files and test files. Organize test files mirroring the application structure (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py`).

2.  **Implement Static Analysis:** Introduce a linter (like Flake8 or pylint) and a code formatter (like Black) to enforce consistent code style and catch potential errors early. Integrate these into your CI/CD pipeline. This promotes code readability and reduces debugging time.
