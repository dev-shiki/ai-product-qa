# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/services/__init__.py`  
**Time**: 04:03:28  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

Please provide the function you want me to add logging statements to. I need the code of the function to be able to add logging effectively.  For example, you could provide something like this:

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
  """Calculates the area of a rectangle."""
  area = width * height
  return area
```

Then I can add logging statements and return the modified function.  My goal is to add logs that show:

*   Function entry with argument values.
*   Key calculations or operations.
*   Return value.
*   Any potential exceptions.

Once you give me the function, I'll provide the version with logging.
