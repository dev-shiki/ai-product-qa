## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport, HTTPStatusError
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.queries.product_service")
async def test_get_brands(mock_service):
    mock_service.get_brands.return_value = ["Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"]
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        try:
            resp = await ac.get("/api/queries/brands")
            resp.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPStatusError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        except HTTPStatusError as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Request failed with status {e.response.status_code}: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert "brands" in data
    assert set(data["brands"]) >= {"Apple", "Samsung", "Sony"}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`resp.raise_for_status()`:** This is the most important addition.  It checks the HTTP status code of the response and raises an `HTTPStatusError` if the status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). This makes the test explicitly fail if the API returns an error, preventing silent failures or misleading results.  Without this, a 500 error could be missed, and the test would continue to assertions against potentially invalid data, leading to incorrect conclusions.
* **`try...except` block:** The code now wraps the `ac.get()` call and the `raise_for_status()` call within a `try...except` block.  This allows us to catch potential errors during the API call.
* **Specific `HTTPStatusError` Handling:** Catches the `HTTPStatusError` specifically. This is the error raised by `raise_for_status()` when a bad status code is returned.  This allows you to handle HTTP errors more gracefully. The error message includes the status code and the error itself, providing valuable debugging information.
* **General `Exception` Handling:** Added a general `except Exception as e` to catch any other unexpected errors that might occur during the API call (e.g., network errors, timeouts).  This prevents the test from crashing due to unforeseen circumstances.  Crucially, it *fails* the test, indicating a problem.
* **`pytest.fail()`:** Instead of just printing an error, `pytest.fail()` is used.  This *immediately* stops the test and marks it as failed, ensuring that you don't get false positives if an error occurs before the assertions.  The failure message provides context on what went wrong.  This is crucial for making the test report accurate.
* **Clear Error Messages:** The error messages in the `except` blocks are now more informative, including the specific error that occurred. This makes it easier to debug the test and the API.

How to use the improved code:

1.  **Replace the original `test_get_brands` function with the improved version.**
2.  **Run your pytest suite.**

Now, if the `/api/queries/brands` endpoint returns a non-200 status code, the test will explicitly fail with a message indicating the status code and the reason for the failure. If any other unexpected error occurs during the request, the test will also fail with an informative message.  This makes your tests much more robust and reliable.
