## Improvement

```python
"""
Service modules for the application.
"""

# Example function - you'll need to adapt this to your specific service logic
def process_data(data):
    """
    Processes the input data.

    Args:
        data: The data to process.  Expected type: dict.

    Returns:
        The processed data.  Type: dict

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input data is not a dictionary.
        ValueError: If data is invalid.
        Exception: For unexpected errors during processing.
    """
    try:
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            raise TypeError("Input data must be a dictionary.")

        # Simulate data validation
        if not all(key in data for key in ["id", "value"]):
            raise ValueError("Input data is missing required keys ('id', 'value').")

        # Simulate some processing logic
        processed_value = data["value"] * 2
        processed_data = {"id": data["id"], "processed_value": processed_value}

        return processed_data

    except TypeError as e:
        # Log the error (replace with your logging mechanism)
        print(f"TypeError in process_data: {e}")  
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to signal failure to the caller
    except ValueError as e:
        # Log the error
        print(f"ValueError in process_data: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the unexpected error
        print(f"Unexpected error in process_data: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception

# Example usage (for testing)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        valid_data = {"id": 1, "value": 10}
        processed = process_data(valid_data)
        print(f"Processed data: {processed}")  # Output: Processed data: {'id': 1, 'processed_value': 20}

        invalid_data = "not a dictionary"
        process_data(invalid_data)  # Raises TypeError

    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Caught TypeError: {e}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught ValueError: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Caught unexpected error: {e}")


```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Explicit Exception Types:**  Instead of a generic `except Exception`, the code now catches more specific exception types like `TypeError` and `ValueError`. This makes debugging easier and allows for different error handling logic depending on the type of error.
* **Input Validation:**  The code includes checks to ensure the input data is of the correct type and contains the expected keys. This prevents errors from propagating further down the line.  Robust validation is crucial.
* **Informative Error Messages:**  The `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions are raised with descriptive error messages, making it easier to understand what went wrong.  The messages guide the user to fix the problem.
* **Logging (Placeholder):** The code includes `print` statements as placeholders for *real* logging.  In a production environment, you should use a proper logging library (like Python's `logging` module) to record errors and other important events.  This is critical for debugging and monitoring your application.  Good logging includes:
    * Timestamp
    * Severity level (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
    * Module/function name
    * Error message
    * Stack trace (if applicable)
* **Re-raising Exceptions:**  Critically, the `except` blocks *re-raise* the exceptions using `raise`.  This is important because the calling code *needs to know* that the function failed.  If you catch an exception and don't re-raise it (or return a default value), the caller might think the function succeeded when it didn't, leading to unexpected behavior later on. The re-raising is essential for proper error propagation and handling in the overall application.
* **Clear Error Handling Strategy:**  The code follows a consistent strategy for error handling:
    1. **Catch specific exceptions:** Handle expected error types (TypeError, ValueError) explicitly.
    2. **Log the error:** Record the error details (using the placeholder `print` statements).  *Replace these with proper logging.*
    3. **Re-raise the exception:** Allow the calling code to handle the error appropriately.
* **Example Usage/Testing:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates how to use the function and how to catch the exceptions that it might raise. This helps ensure the error handling is working as expected.
* **Docstring with Error Information:**  The docstring clearly documents what errors the function might raise.  This helps developers understand how to use the function and what to expect in case of errors.
* **Specific Instructions:**  The docstring includes the expected `type` for function arguments.

How to Adapt This to *Your* Code:

1. **Replace the Example Logic:** The `process_data` function is just an example.  You need to replace the data validation and processing logic with the actual logic of your service module.
2. **Identify Potential Errors:** Think about all the things that could go wrong in your service module:
   * Invalid input data
   * Network errors (if you're calling external services)
   * File I/O errors
   * Database errors
   * Unexpected data formats
3. **Catch Specific Exceptions:** For each potential error, identify the specific exception type that Python will raise (e.g., `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `IOError`, `socket.error`, `KeyError`).
4. **Add Validation:** Include validation checks to prevent errors before they happen.
5. **Log Errors:** Use the `logging` module (or a similar logging library) to record error details.
6. **Re-raise Exceptions:** Make sure to re-raise the exceptions so that the calling code knows that the function failed.
7. **Add Docstrings:** Document the possible exceptions in the docstring.

This improved version provides a much more robust and maintainable approach to error handling, making your service modules more reliable and easier to debug.  Remember to replace the placeholder logging with a real logging implementation.
