## Quick Insights

Given the project structure, consider these improvements:

1.  **Centralized Configuration:** Instead of potentially scattering configuration values across files, introduce a central configuration file (e.g., `config.py`) or use environment variables. This enhances maintainability and allows for easier deployment and environment-specific settings.

2.  **Comprehensive Testing Coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 source files, focus on increasing test coverage. Prioritize testing core functionalities, edge cases, and critical models like `product.py`. Aim for a coverage report to identify areas needing more attention and strive for high code coverage percentage for essential parts of the application.
