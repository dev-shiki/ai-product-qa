## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions for improving your Python project:

1.  **Consistent Code Style:**  Use a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and a formatter (like `black`) to enforce a consistent code style across all 21 Python files. This improves readability and maintainability, making it easier for you and others to understand the code.

2.  **Test Organization:**  Consider using a more structured test directory organization mirroring your `app` directory (e.g., `tests/api/test_queries.py`). This improves test discoverability and makes it easier to write and maintain tests as your project grows.
