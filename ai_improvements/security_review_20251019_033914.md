from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional

product_service = ProductDataService()

@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProductResponse])
async def get_products(
    limit: Optional[int] = Query(20, le=100, ge=1, description="Maximum number of products to return (1-100)"),
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    search: Optional[str] = None
):
    """Get products from local data source"""

        products = await product_service.get_products(
            limit=limit,
            category=category,
            search=search
        )
        return products
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

async def search_products(query: str, limit: Optional[int] = Query(10, le=50, ge=1, description="Maximum number of products to return (1-50)")):

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The security improvement implemented is **Input Validation using `Query` with range restrictions on the `limit` parameter**.  Specifically:

*   **`Query(..., le=100, ge=1, description="...")`:**  This change replaces the direct default value assignment (`limit: Optional[int] = 20`) with the `Query` parameter.  Here's how it enhances security:

    *   **Input Validation:** `Query` allows you to define validation rules for query parameters. In this case, `le=100` (less than or equal to 100) and `ge=1` (greater than or equal to 1) restrict the allowed values for the `limit` parameter.  This prevents a malicious user from specifying a very large `limit` value that could potentially overload the server by requesting excessive data, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. It also prevents the limit from being zero or negative, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `product_service`.
    *   **Documentation and User Experience:** The `description` argument provides clear information in the API documentation (generated by FastAPI) about the expected range for the `limit` parameter, improving the user experience and helping developers use the API correctly.
    *   **Automatic Error Handling:**  FastAPI automatically validates the input against the defined rules. If a user provides a `limit` value outside the specified range (1-100), FastAPI will automatically return an HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error with a descriptive message, preventing the invalid value from being passed to the `product_service`.

**Why this is important:**

Without input validation, a malicious user could potentially exploit the API by sending requests with very large `limit` values. This could:

1.  **Overload the Database:**  A large `limit` could force the `product_service` to retrieve and process a huge amount of data from the database, potentially slowing down the database server and affecting other applications that rely on it.
2.  **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** If the server is unable to handle the request for a large number of products, it could become unresponsive, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
3.  **Memory Exhaustion:** Processing a very large dataset could consume excessive memory on the server, potentially leading to crashes or instability.

By implementing input validation with `Query`, we mitigate these risks and ensure that the API can only process requests within acceptable limits.  The same type of validation is added to the other `limit` parameters.
