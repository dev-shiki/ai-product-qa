# Logging Enhancement

**File**: `./app/api/products.py`  
**Time**: 02:55:40  
**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.product_data_service import ProductDataService
from app.models.product import ProductResponse
from typing import List, Optional
import logging

router = APIRouter()
product_service = ProductDataService()

# Configure logging (basic configuration for this example)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@router.get("/categories")
async def get_categories():
    """Get available product categories"""
    logger.info("Getting product categories.")  # Log entry

    try:
        categories = await product_service.get_categories()
        logger.info(f"Successfully retrieved categories: {categories}") # Log successful retrieval
        return {"categories": categories}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Error retrieving categories.") # Log error with traceback
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  Crucially, you need to import the `logging` module to use it.
* **Basic Configuration (Crucial):**  `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up the logging system.  Without this, you may not see any output.  `level=logging.INFO` means that INFO level messages and higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be logged.  You can adjust this level as needed.  This configuration should ideally be done once in your application's startup, not within each function.  A more complete configuration is shown below.
* **Get a Logger:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger instance.  `__name__` is the name of the current module (e.g., "app.api.endpoints.products"), which helps identify where the log messages are coming from.
* **`logger.info()`:** Used for general informational messages. This shows that the route was accessed and, if successful, what data was returned.
* **`logger.exception()`:**  This is the *most important* change.  Instead of just `logger.error()`, use `logger.exception()`.  This automatically includes the exception's traceback in the log message, making debugging *much* easier.  It should only be used *inside* an `except` block to capture the exception that was raised.  It implicitly logs at the ERROR level.
* **Log Messages:** The log messages are designed to be informative. They indicate the start of the process, the successful retrieval of data, and any errors that occur.  Including the retrieved categories in the success message can be very helpful for debugging.  Avoid logging sensitive information!
* **Placement:** The log messages are placed strategically to provide a clear picture of what's happening during the function's execution.

**Example of a more complete logging configuration (usually in `main.py` or a dedicated logging setup file):**

```python
import logging
import sys

def setup_logging():
    """Configures the logging system."""
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)  # Set the default level for all loggers

    # Create handlers
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)  # Log to console
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler("app.log")  # Log to a file

    # Create formatters
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
    console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    # Add handlers to the logger
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)


# In your main application file (e.g., main.py):
# from app.core.logging import setup_logging  # Assuming you put the above in app/core/logging.py

# setup_logging()  # Call this at the start of your application

```

This more comprehensive configuration:

1. **Logs to both console and file.**
2. **Uses a formatted log message:**  `%(asctime)s` (timestamp), `%(name)s` (logger name), `%(levelname)s` (log level), `%(message)s` (the actual message). This makes the logs much easier to read and analyze.
3. **Centralizes the logging setup:**  This is crucial for consistency across your application.  You call `setup_logging()` only once at application startup.
4. **Uses `sys.stdout`:**  This ensures that the console output is directed to the standard output stream, which is important for containerized environments (like Docker).

With the logging in place, you'll be able to track the execution of your API, identify any errors that occur, and debug your code more effectively.  Remember to tailor the log messages and logging level to your specific needs.  Avoid logging sensitive data!
