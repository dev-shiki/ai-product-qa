## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import os

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
    # Check if the VERSION environment variable is set and its value matches the expected version.
    assert response.json()["version"] == os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0")
```

**Explanation of Security Improvement:**

The original code hardcoded the version number "1.0.0" within the `test_health` function.  This is a potential issue because:

1.  **Hardcoded values are difficult to maintain:** When the API version changes, you have to remember to update it in the test code.  If you forget, your tests will fail (or worse, pass with the wrong version number).
2.  **Security vulnerability if version check is used for authorization:** Although less relevant to this particular test, more generally, hardcoding version numbers can be a potential security vulnerability if the version number is used as part of an authorization or access control mechanism.  Attackers could potentially spoof the version number if it's not managed securely.
3.  **Missing way to update the version of API:** The original code can not be updated without changing the code in the file itself

To improve this, the corrected code leverages environment variables. We retrieve the API version from the `VERSION` environment variable using `os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0")`.

*   **`os.environ.get("VERSION", "1.0.0")`**: This attempts to retrieve the value of the `VERSION` environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, it defaults to "1.0.0".

**Benefits:**

*   **Configuration Flexibility:** The API version can now be configured outside of the code, for example, during deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, or other environment configuration tools.
*   **Improved Security:** By sourcing the version from an environment variable, you can manage the version as part of your infrastructure secrets. This makes it less likely that the version will be accidentally exposed in the source code.
*   **Ease of Maintenance:** Updating the API version only requires modifying the environment variable, without having to modify and redeploy the test code.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Set the `VERSION` environment variable:** Before running the tests, you can set the `VERSION` environment variable:

    ```bash
    export VERSION=1.1.0
    pytest
    ```

    If you don't set the environment variable, the test will still pass, as it will use the default value of "1.0.0". This prevents breaking changes to existing setup.

This change, while seemingly small, improves the security and maintainability of the tests by externalizing configuration.  This is a common and important security practice.
