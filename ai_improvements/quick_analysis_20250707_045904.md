# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 04:59:04  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Given the project structure (21 .py files, 8 test files, with `app` directory and API sub-directory), two immediate improvements are:

1.  **Implement a linter and formatter (like Flake8 and Black):** Consistent code style and early error detection will drastically improve maintainability across 21 files. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Improve Test Coverage and Structure:** While you have 8 test files, ensure they achieve high code coverage. Use a tool like `pytest-cov` to measure it. Organize tests logically, mirroring the application structure (e.g., `tests/api/test_products.py`).
