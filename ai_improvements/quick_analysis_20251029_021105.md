## Quick Insights

1. **Centralize configuration:** Instead of hardcoding settings (database URLs, API keys) in various files, use a configuration file (e.g., `config.py` or `.env`) and a library like `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables. This improves maintainability and security.

2. **Standardize logging:** Implement a consistent logging system (using Python's `logging` module) across all modules. This will significantly help with debugging and monitoring the application's behavior in production, especially given the growing number of files. This helps with debugging.
