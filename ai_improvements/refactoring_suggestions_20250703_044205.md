## Improvement

```python
"""Services: Encapsulate business logic and data access."""
```

**Explanation of Refactoring Improvement:**

*   **More Specific Docstring:** The original docstring "Service modules for the application." is vague.  The refactored docstring "Services: Encapsulate business logic and data access." provides more context. It clearly communicates the purpose and responsibility of the modules contained within the package or file being documented. Specifically, it highlights that these modules should handle business logic (the core rules and processes of the application) and data access (interacting with databases, APIs, or other data sources).
