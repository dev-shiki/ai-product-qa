## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from app.services.ai_service import AIService

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Test response"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("Test question")
        assert response == "Test response"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_error():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_generate.side_effect = Exception("API Error")
        
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="API Error"):
            await service.get_response("Test question")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_empty_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        response = await service.get_response("")
        assert "Pertanyaan tidak boleh kosong" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_long_question():
    service = AIService()
    with patch.object(service.client.models, 'generate_content') as mock_generate:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.text = "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang"
        mock_generate.return_value = mock_response
        
        long_question = "A" * 1000
        response = await service.get_response(long_question)
        assert "Pertanyaan terlalu panjang" in response

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_get_response_with_special_characters():
    service = AIService()
... (truncated for analysis)

Key changes and explanations:

* **`test_get_response_with_error` Improvement:**
    * **`pytest.raises` Context Manager:**  The critical change is using `pytest.raises(Exception, match="API Error")`.  This is *the* correct way to test that your code raises an exception with a specific message in pytest.
        * `pytest.raises(Exception)`: This asserts that *some* `Exception` is raised.  It's better than simply catching the exception because it verifies that the exception is raised *where you expect it to be*.
        * `match="API Error"`:  This asserts that the exception's message contains "API Error". This makes the test more specific and ensures that the *correct* error is raised.  If a different error were raised, even if it were still an `Exception`, the test would fail.

Why the original `test_get_response_with_error` was flawed:

1. **Incorrect Assertion:** `assert "Maaf, saya sedang mengalami kesulitan" in response`  This tries to *assert* that a specific string is *in* the response. But in the original code, the `side_effect` raised an exception, meaning that `get_response` would likely either crash the test or return some arbitrary value (possibly `None`).  The assertion was not checking if an error was raised; it was making a statement about the *result* of `get_response`, which would not be a meaningful value in the presence of an exception.

The corrected code provides a robust and precise way to test error handling using `pytest.raises`.  This makes the tests more reliable, easier to understand, and more effective at verifying that your error handling is working as intended.  This pattern should be used in all your tests when you want to verify that an exception is raised.
