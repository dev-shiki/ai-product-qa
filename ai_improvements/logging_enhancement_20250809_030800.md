## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service):
    logger.debug("Starting test_get_products")
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])
    logger.debug("Mock service configured.")
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        logger.debug("Sending GET request to /api/products/")
        resp = await ac.get("/api/products/")
    logger.debug(f"Received response with status code: {resp.status_code}")
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    logger.debug(f"Response data: {data}")
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)
    logger.debug("All assertions passed. test_get_products completed successfully.")

```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Explicit Logger:**  Instead of relying on a default logger, the code now creates a logger specifically for this module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`.  This is crucial for organizing and filtering logs in larger projects.  The `__name__` ensures the logger is named after the module.
* **Basic Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` is added.  This is *essential* to actually see any logs. Without it, the logger may be created, but the messages are not displayed because the root logger is not configured.  The level is set to DEBUG to show all logging levels.  This would normally be configured project-wide, but included here for completeness.  In a real application, you'd likely configure logging centrally, possibly in the `app.main` file.
* **Strategic Logging:** The `logger.debug()` calls are inserted at key points:
    * Start of the test.
    * After mocking the service.
    * Before sending the request.
    * After receiving the response, including the status code.
    *  Logs the data that is returned for easy viewing.
    * End of the test (success case).  This helps confirm the test ran to completion.
* **f-strings for Context:**  f-strings are used to embed the status code and response data directly into the log messages, making the logs much more informative.
* **Clear Messages:** The log messages are now more descriptive (e.g., "Sending GET request to...", "Received response with status code...").
* **Error Handling Considerations (Important):**  While this example focuses on success, robust logging would *also* include `try...except` blocks around the `ac.get()` call to log any exceptions that occur during the request.  This is critical for debugging failures.
* **Level Appropriateness:** `logger.debug()` is used since these are mostly for detailed troubleshooting and not necessarily something you'd want to see in production.  If some of these messages were important for operational monitoring, you might use `logger.info()` or `logger.warning()` instead.

This revised answer provides a much more complete and practical example of how to add effective logging to a test function. Remember to adjust the logging level and message content to fit the specific needs of your project.  Also, be aware that the logging level can be dynamically changed at runtime if desired.
