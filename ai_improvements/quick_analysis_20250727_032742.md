**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions for improvement, assuming standard practices haven't been implemented:

1.  **Consider a Linter & Formatter:** Implement a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and a code formatter (like Black). This ensures code consistency and helps catch potential errors early. It reduces stylistic debates during code reviews and improves readability across all 21 files.

2.  **Evaluate Test Coverage:** With only 8 test files for 21 Python files, it's worth assessing the test coverage. Are key modules and functions thoroughly tested? Tools like `pytest-cov` can help identify areas needing more test cases. Aim for high coverage to ensure code reliability.
