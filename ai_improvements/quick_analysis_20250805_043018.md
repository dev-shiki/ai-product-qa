# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 04:30:18  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Consider using a linter and formatter (e.g., flake8 and Black).**  Running these tools will ensure consistent code style across all 29 files, making the project more readable and maintainable.  They automatically catch common errors and formatting issues, freeing you to focus on logic.

2.  **Evaluate test coverage.** Eight test files for 21 source files might indicate low test coverage. Use a tool like `coverage.py` to measure how much of your code is actually exercised by the tests. Target for 80% or higher coverage to reduce bugs and increase confidence in your code.
