# Logging Enhancement

**Type**: logging_enhancement

## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health():
    from app.main import app
    logger.info("Starting test_health")
    try:
        async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
            logger.info("Sending GET request to /health")
            response = await ac.get("/health")
            logger.info(f"Received response with status code: {response.status_code}")

        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
        assert response.json()["version"] == "1.0.0"
        logger.info("test_health completed successfully")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"An error occurred during test_health: {e}")
        raise
    

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_root():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json() == {"message": "Product Assistant API - Ready to help you find products"}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Import `logging`:**  The core requirement to use the logging module.
* **Basic Logging Configuration:** `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` sets up the basic logging system.  This is *essential*. Without this, the logging calls won't produce any output.  `level=logging.INFO` means that only messages of INFO level or higher (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) will be displayed.  You can change this to `logging.DEBUG` for more verbose output.
* **Create a Logger Instance:** `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` creates a logger specific to this module.  This is best practice;  using the root logger directly is generally discouraged.  `__name__` will be the name of the module (e.g., "test_file" if this code is in `test_file.py`). This makes it easier to trace where log messages originate.
* **Log Messages:**  I've added several `logger.info()` calls to log various stages of the function's execution:
    * `"Starting test_health"`: Indicates when the function begins.
    * `"Sending GET request to /health"`: Records that the GET request is being made.
    * `f"Received response with status code: {response.status_code}"`: Logs the response code.
    * `"test_health completed successfully"`:  Marks the successful completion of the function.
* **Error Handling with Logging:**  Critically, I've added a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions. Inside the `except` block:
    * `logger.exception(f"An error occurred during test_health: {e}")`: This is the most important addition.  `logger.exception()` logs the exception message *and* the full stack trace.  This is incredibly helpful for debugging because you get the context of where the error occurred. Using an f-string ensures you have the specific exception instance in the log.
    * `raise`: Re-raises the exception after logging it.  This is important because you still want the test to fail if there's an error.  If you didn't re-raise, the test would pass even if there was a problem, which is usually not what you want.
* **Clear and Informative Messages:** The log messages are written to be as clear and informative as possible, so you can easily understand what the code is doing and what's going on if something goes wrong.
* **`f-strings`:** Using f-strings (e.g., `f"Received response with status code: {response.status_code}"`) makes it easy to include variable values in your log messages.

How to Run and See the Logs:

1. **Save the code:** Save the modified code as a Python file (e.g., `test_example.py`).
2. **Run pytest:** Run the tests using `pytest test_example.py -s`. The `-s` flag is crucial; it tells pytest *not* to capture the standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr), which is where the log messages go.  Without `-s`, you won't see the logs in your terminal.
3. **Examine the output:** You'll see the normal pytest output, but now interspersed with your log messages. If the test fails, the exception and traceback will be clearly printed in the console thanks to `logger.exception()`.

This revised response provides a complete and correct solution for adding effective logging to your pytest function, including proper error handling, configuration, and instructions for viewing the logs. It also highlights the importance of the `-s` flag.
