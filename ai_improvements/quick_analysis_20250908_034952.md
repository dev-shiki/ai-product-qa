## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Implement a Linter and Formatter:** Consistent code style improves readability and reduces errors. Use a linter (like flake8 or pylint) and a formatter (like Black) to enforce consistent style across all files. Integrate these tools into your pre-commit hooks for automated checks.

2.  **Consider adding Type Hints:** Adding Type Hints throughout the project (especially in frequently used modules like `app/utils/config.py`) enhances code clarity and allows static analysis tools like MyPy to catch potential type-related errors before runtime. This significantly boosts code maintainability and reliability.
