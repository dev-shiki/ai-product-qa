## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions for your Python project:

1.  **Improve testability:** Analyze code complexity, especially in `app/main.py`. High complexity can make testing difficult. Consider refactoring complex functions into smaller, testable units with clear inputs and outputs.
2.  **Enhance modularity:**  Given the number of files, ensure proper separation of concerns.  Review `app/models/product.py` and other model files to confirm they only handle data representation and logic related to those models.  Avoid business logic within the model definitions; move it to separate service/logic layers.
