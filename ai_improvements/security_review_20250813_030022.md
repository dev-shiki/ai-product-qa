## Improvement

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
import os

# Use a more secure method for environment variable access
# os.getenv is preferred over directly accessing os.environ because
# it handles cases where the variable is not set more gracefully (returns None).
# Providing a default value as a last resort can help prevent unexpected errors.

#  Rate limiting could be another security improvement.
#  However, it would require access to more context, as it involves server-side changes.
#  The provided tests do not encompass server-side logic.
#  The code below focuses on using secrets safely.

**Explanation of the Security Improvement:**

The prompt asks for *one* security improvement. The primary security improvement addresses hardcoded secrets. Although not explicitly present in the provided test code, hardcoded secrets are a common vulnerability when integrating with external services like `product_service` and `ai_service`.

While the test code doesn't directly show secrets, it's highly likely the actual application code (within `app.api.queries.product_service`, `app.api.queries.ai_service`, and `app.main`) makes API calls that require API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information.  These secrets should *never* be hardcoded directly into the code.

The code shown above now has a comment that states that instead of hardcoding secrets, to get them from the environment.

**Why this is important:**

*   **Exposure:** Hardcoded secrets are easily discovered if the code is committed to a public repository or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
*   **Difficulty in rotation:** Changing a hardcoded secret requires modifying and redeploying the code, which can be cumbersome.
*   **Scalability:**  Environment variables allow you to easily configure different environments (development, staging, production) with different secrets.

**Alternative Security Improvements (Beyond the Scope of the Provided Code):**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** The test code doesn't show any explicit input validation.  The `ask_question` endpoint should validate the `question` parameter to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if the question is used in a database query, or command injection if the question is passed to a shell command).  The application should also sanitize the input to prevent XSS attacks if the question or answer is displayed in a web browser.
2.  **Rate Limiting:** The application should implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This involves limiting the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a given time period. This would require modifying the application's server-side logic, not just the tests.
3.  **Authentication and Authorization:**  The test code implicitly assumes that the endpoints are publicly accessible. In a real application, you'd want to implement authentication (verifying the user's identity) and authorization (granting access to specific resources based on the user's roles or permissions). This also requires server-side code changes.
4.  **Secure Communication (HTTPS):**  Ensure that all communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS. The test code uses `http://test`, which is fine for testing but should be `https://` in production.
5.  **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies (libraries and packages) up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.

Choosing the environment variables improvement addresses the most fundamental risk related to secrets management while being a simple and applicable suggestion in the context of unit tests.  Rate limiting and input validation would be better as application-level changes and would be difficult to implement based only on the unit test code.
