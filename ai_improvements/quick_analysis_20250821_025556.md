# Quick Project Analysis

**Time**: 02:55:56  
**Files**: 21 Python, 8 Tests

## Quick Insights

1. **Standardize Code Style:** With 21 files, inconsistent code style can creep in. Implement a linter like `flake8` or `pylint` and a formatter like `black` for automatic code style enforcement. This will improve readability and maintainability across the project.

2. **Improve Test Coverage:** Aim for higher test coverage beyond just the 8 test files. Identify critical areas and edge cases in `app/api/queries.py` and `app/api/products.py`, for example, and write tests to ensure their reliability. Use a coverage tool like `coverage.py` to track your progress.
