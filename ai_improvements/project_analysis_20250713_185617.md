## Improvement

**Optimization:** Move the `AsyncClient` fixture outside the test functions.

**Improvement:**

```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock

@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    from app.main import app
    async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products(mock_service, async_client):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
            "condition": "Baru",
            "shop_location": "Indonesia",
            "shop_name": "Apple Store"
        },
        "images": ["https://example.com/P001.jpg"],
        "url": "https://shopee.co.id/P001"
    }])

    resp = await async_client.get("/api/products/")
    assert resp.status_code == 200
    data = resp.json()
    assert isinstance(data, list)
    assert len(data) > 0
    assert all("id" in p and "name" in p for p in data)

@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch("app.api.products.product_service")
async def test_get_products_with_category(mock_service, async_client):
    mock_service.get_products = AsyncMock(return_value=[{
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "iPhone 15 Pro Max",
        "category": "smartphone",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "price": 21999000,
        "currency": "IDR",
        "description": "iPhone 15 Pro Max dengan titanium design, kamera 48MP, dan performa terbaik",
        "specifications": {
            "rating": 4.8,
            "sold": 100,
            "stock": 25,
... (truncated for analysis)

**Explanation:**

Creating the `AsyncClient` within each test function sets up and tears down the client for every single test.  By using a pytest fixture, the `AsyncClient` is created *once* at the beginning of the test session (or at the beginning of the scope defined for the fixture) and reused across multiple test functions.  This reduces the overhead associated with creating and closing the client connection, leading to faster test execution. Specifically, setting up the ASGI environment and HTTP connection are relatively expensive operations.

This approach also promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy within the test suite, making it easier to maintain and reason about.
