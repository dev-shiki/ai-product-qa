## Quick Insights

Here are two quick suggestions for improving your Python project:

1. **Implement a linter and formatter (like Flake8 and Black):** This ensures consistent code style across all 21 files, improving readability and reducing potential errors. Integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.

2. **Improve testing structure and coverage:**  With 8 test files for 21 Python files, assess test coverage. Consider using a coverage tool. Organize tests logically, possibly mirroring your `app` directory structure, to make them easier to navigate and maintain. Aim for good code coverage.
