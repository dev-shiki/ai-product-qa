**Explanation:**

The provided code contains a potential vulnerability to prompt injection.  The `request.question` is directly passed to the `ai_service.get_response()` function.  This could allow a malicious user to craft a question that includes instructions to the AI model, potentially bypassing intended behavior or extracting sensitive information.

The security improvement is to implement **input sanitization/validation** on the `request.question` *before* sending it to the AI service.  While a full sanitization strategy depends on the expected input and AI model's capabilities, a basic and initial safeguard is implemented.

Specifically:
*   **Basic Input Validation:**  The code should be modified to include input validation to ensure the 'question' is within an expected length.
*   **Defense in Depth:** In addition to sanitization, implement rate limiting on the API endpoint to prevent abuse. You should also closely monitor the AI service's behavior and outputs to detect and respond to any prompt injection attempts.

This change adds a layer of protection against prompt injection attacks by mitigating the direct access of user-controlled input to the AI model, enhancing the overall security of the application.
