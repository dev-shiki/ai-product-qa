**Explanation of the security improvement:  Cryptographically Secure Random Token Generation**

The code now includes the `generate_secure_token` function.  This addresses the critical security need for generating random, unpredictable tokens for various purposes (e.g., session IDs, API keys, password reset tokens).

**Why it's more secure:**

1. **`secrets` Module:** The `secrets` module is used.  This is Python's built-in module designed specifically for generating cryptographically secure random numbers and strings.  It's preferred over `random` (which is pseudorandom and predictable) when security is a concern.

2. **Sufficient Length:** The default token length is 32 bytes (256 bits).  This is a reasonable length to prevent collision attacks (where an attacker can guess or brute-force a valid token).  The length is configurable.

3. **Hexadecimal Encoding:** The token is returned as a hexadecimal string.  This makes it easier to store and transmit as text.

4. **Error Handling and Logging:**  The function includes error handling using a `try...except` block and logs any errors that occur during token generation.  Logging is essential for debugging and auditing security-related events.

5. **Hashing with Salt:** The `hash_password` function is included to demonstrate password hashing best practices.  Salting is crucial to prevent rainbow table attacks.  The function generates a new random salt for each password if one isn't provided.

**How to use it:**

*   `secure_token = generate_secure_token()`:  Generates a new secure token.
*   `secure_token = generate_secure_token(64)`: Generates a longer token (64 bytes).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Storage:**  Store the generated tokens and salts securely (e.g., encrypted in a database). Never store passwords in plain text.
*   **Token Expiration:** Implement token expiration mechanisms to limit the window of opportunity for attackers to use compromised tokens.
*   **Transport:**  Always transmit tokens over secure channels (HTTPS) to prevent interception.
*   **Logging:** Keep detailed logs of token generation and usage for security auditing. Review these logs regularly for suspicious activity.
*   **Context:**  The "service modules" need to be understood in the context of the entire application.  This is just one piece of the puzzle.  Other security considerations include authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, and secure communication.
*   **Remove Example Code:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is just for demonstration.  Remove it when you integrate the functions into your actual service modules.

This revised response provides a practical, secure, and well-explained improvement to the original code, focusing on the critical aspect of cryptographically secure token generation and password hashing. The code is also more robust with error handling and logging.
