## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvement suggestions:

1.  **Implement linting and formatting:** Introduce a tool like `flake8` or `pylint` with a pre-commit hook to automatically check code style and potential errors before committing.  Use a formatter like `black` to standardize code appearance. This improves code readability and reduces inconsistencies across the project.

2.  **Review Test Coverage:**  With 8 test files and 21 code files, it's crucial to analyze test coverage.  Use a tool like `coverage.py` to identify untested parts of the code. Aim for high coverage to ensure code reliability, especially in critical areas like `./app/api/queries.py` and `./app/api/products.py`.
