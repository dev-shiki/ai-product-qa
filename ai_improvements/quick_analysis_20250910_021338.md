## Quick Insights

Here are two quick improvements based on the given information:

1.  **Type Hinting:**  Implement type hinting throughout the project, especially in `main.py` and `config.py`. This improves code readability, maintainability, and helps catch errors early through static analysis tools.  Consider using a tool like `mypy` to enforce type checking.

2.  **Centralized Configuration:**  Ensure the `config.py` file provides a clear and well-documented interface for accessing configuration parameters. If configurations vary, use a library like `pydantic` or `dataclasses` for structured configuration and validation, improving robustness.
