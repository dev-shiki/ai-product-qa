## Improvement

Okay, I need the function you want me to add logging to.  Please provide the function definition.

However, I can give you a general example of how to add logging to a function in Python using the `logging` module.  Let's say you have a function like this:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
  """Calculates the sum of two numbers."""
  result = a + b
  return result
```

Here's how you might add logging to it:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging (usually done at the module level, not inside the function)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')


def calculate_sum(a, b):
  """Calculates the sum of two numbers."""
  logging.info(f"Calculating sum of {a} and {b}")  # Log input values
  result = a + b
  logging.info(f"Sum is: {result}")  # Log the result
  return result
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`import logging`:**  Imports the necessary `logging` module.
* **`logging.basicConfig(...)`:**  This is typically done *once* at the module level (outside the function) to configure the logging system.  It sets the logging level (e.g., `logging.INFO`, `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.WARNING`, `logging.ERROR`, `logging.CRITICAL`) and the format of the log messages.  I've included a basic configuration that's suitable for many applications.  You can customize the format and level as needed.
* **`logging.info(...)`:**  This is the core logging statement.  `logging.info()` logs a message at the `INFO` level.  I've used f-strings (formatted string literals) to include the values of variables directly in the log message.  You can use other formatting methods if you prefer.
* **Placement of logging statements:**
    * **Before the calculation:**  This logs the input values, which is helpful for debugging.
    * **After the calculation:** This logs the result.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Logging Level:**  Choose the appropriate logging level.  `INFO` is good for general information.  `DEBUG` is for detailed debugging information.  `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` are for more serious issues.  Use the logging level that best reflects the severity of the message.
* **Configuration:**  The `logging.basicConfig()` call provides a simple default configuration. For more complex applications, you'll likely want to use a logging configuration file or configure the logger programmatically.
* **Performance:**  Excessive logging can impact performance.  Be mindful of the amount of logging you add, especially in performance-critical sections of your code.  Use `DEBUG` level logging for information that you only need during development.
* **Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **Contextual Information:** Include as much contextual information in your log messages as possible to make them useful for debugging. This might include user IDs, request IDs, or other relevant data.

Now, please provide your function so I can add the logging statements appropriately for your specific code.  I will tailor the logging to the function's purpose and variables.
