## Improvement

```python
from app.models.product import Product, ProductSpecifications, ProductResponse

def test_product_specifications():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=4.5, sold=100, stock=10, condition="Baru", shop_location="Jakarta", shop_name="Toko A", storage="128GB", color="Hitam", warranty="1 tahun")
    assert spec.rating == 4.5
    assert spec.sold == 100
    assert spec.shop_location == "Jakarta"
    assert spec.color == "Hitam"

def test_product():
    spec = ProductSpecifications(rating=5)
    product = Product(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        currency="IDR",
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications=spec,
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert product.id == "1"
    assert product.specifications.rating == 5
    assert product.images == ["img1.jpg"]

def test_product_response():
    resp = ProductResponse(
        id="1",
        name="Produk A",
        category="Elektronik",
        brand="BrandX",
        price=1000000,
        description="Deskripsi produk",
        specifications={"rating": 5},
        images=["img1.jpg"],
        url="http://produk.com/1"
    )
    assert resp.id == "1"
    # Improved error handling: Check if the key exists before accessing it.
    try:
        assert resp.specifications["rating"] == 5
    except KeyError:
        print("Key 'rating' not found in specifications.")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to fail the test.  Alternatively, you could use assert False here.
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        raise # Re-raise or assert False, depending on desired behavior
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`try...except` Block:** The core improvement is wrapping the potentially problematic access `resp.specifications["rating"]` within a `try...except` block.  This allows us to gracefully handle the `KeyError` that occurs if the "rating" key is missing from the `specifications` dictionary.
* **Specific `KeyError` Handling:**  The `except KeyError:` clause specifically catches the `KeyError`, which is the most likely error in this scenario.  This makes the error handling more targeted and avoids catching unrelated exceptions.
* **Informative Error Message:**  Instead of silently failing, the `except KeyError:` block now prints a user-friendly error message: `print("Key 'rating' not found in specifications.")`. This helps with debugging and understanding why the test failed.
* **Re-raising the Exception (or `assert False`):**  Critically, the `except` block now `raise`s the exception (`raise`) after printing the error message.  This is *essential* because simply catching the exception without re-raising it would cause the test to pass even if the "rating" key is missing, which is incorrect.  Re-raising ensures that the test fails as expected.  An alternative would be to use `assert False`, which always causes an assertion error and fails the test, which may be appropriate if you *always* want the test to fail if the key is missing.
* **General Exception Handling:** Added a second `except` to catch general exceptions that may occur. This is for unforeseen circumstances and helps prevent the program from crashing unexpectedly.

This improved error handling makes the test more robust, easier to debug, and ensures that it accurately reflects the expected behavior of the code.  The key here is that the test *must* fail if accessing `resp.specifications["rating"]` raises a `KeyError`.  Without re-raising, the test would incorrectly pass.
