**Security Improvement:**

*   **JSON Parsing Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block around `resp.json()` to catch `json.JSONDecodeError`.  If the response body is *not* valid JSON (e.g., due to a server error returning HTML, or a malformed JSON response), the original code would crash.  The added `try...except` allows the test to fail gracefully with a more informative error message using `pytest.fail()`, indicating that the server returned an invalid response.  This prevents the test from passing incorrectly when the response from the server is not in the expected format.  This is a form of input validation - verifying that the incoming data (the API response) is in the correct format *before* processing it.  Failure to do so could lead to unpredictable behavior or even vulnerabilities.

**Explanation:**

The primary security concern addressed is around how API responses are handled.  Without proper error handling during JSON parsing, unexpected or malformed responses can cause failures that might be misinterpreted as successful tests, or worse, could be exploited. By explicitly handling `json.JSONDecodeError`, the code becomes more robust and reliable, ensuring that the application correctly interprets and handles API responses. This contributes to better security by preventing unexpected failures or misinterpretations of data.
