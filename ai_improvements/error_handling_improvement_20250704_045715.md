## Improvement

```python
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from app.services.local_product_service import LocalProductService

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductDataService:
    """
    Service untuk mengambil data produk dari sumber lokal yang reliable
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Use LocalProductService as primary data source
        self.local_service = LocalProductService()
        logger.info("ProductDataService initialized with LocalProductService")
    
    async def search_products(self, keyword: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search products using local data"""
        try:
            logger.info(f"Searching products with keyword: {keyword}")
            # Use awaitable wrapper for sync method
            import asyncio
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            products = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.local_service.search_products, keyword, limit)
            logger.info(f"Found {len(products)} products for keyword: {keyword}")
            return products
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error searching products with keyword: {keyword}") # Changed to logger.exception
            return []
    
    async def get_products(self, limit: int = 20, category: Optional[str] = None, search: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
        """Get products with optional filtering"""
        try:
            if search:
                return await self.search_products(search, limit)
            elif category:
                return await self.get_products_by_category(category, limit)
            else:
                return await self.get_all_products(limit)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting products with limit: {limit}, category: {category}, search: {search}") # Changed to logger.exception and included context
            # Attempt to return data from local_service even in case of error.  This ensures that we at least attempt to return *something*
            try:
                return self.local_service.get_products(limit)
            except Exception as fallback_e:
                logger.exception(f"Fallback to local_service.get_products also failed: {fallback_e}")
                return []
    
    async def get_categories(self) -> List[str]:
        """Get available categories"""
        try:
            return self.local_service.get_categories()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error getting categories") # Changed to logger.exception
            return []
... (truncated for analysis)

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`logger.exception` instead of `logger.error`:**  This is the most important change. `logger.exception` *automatically* logs the exception's stack trace along with the error message. This provides significantly more information for debugging, making it much easier to pinpoint the source of the error.  Without the stack trace, you only know *that* an error occurred, but not *where* it occurred within the `try` block.

* **Contextual Logging:** I've added contextual information to the log messages.  For example, in `get_products`, the log message now includes the `limit`, `category`, and `search` parameters.  This makes it easier to understand the specific circumstances that led to the error.

* **Improved Fallback Handling in `get_products`:** Added a nested `try...except` block around the fallback call to `self.local_service.get_products(limit)`.  This addresses the potential for *that* call to also fail. If the fallback fails, it logs the failure using `logger.exception` and returns an empty list, preventing cascading failures. This is crucial for resilience.

* **Avoided `f"Error: {e=}"` syntax:** While technically valid, using `f"Error: {e=}"` is generally discouraged in production code unless you explicitly want the *exact* representation of the exception object. `str(e)` usually provides a more user-friendly error message. More importantly, the stack trace is the critical thing to log.

* **Removed Redundant `await`:** Removed unnecessary `await` keywords that were causing type errors in the original code.

This revised code provides much more robust error handling with detailed logging, including stack traces, and attempts to provide a useful response even when errors occur.  The contextual logging significantly improves debuggability. The fallback error handling in `get_products` makes it far more resilient.
